        "Light, comfortable and clean beautiful design. They are warm but not overwhelmingly so. Details in the mid and high are clear and non fatiguing. They lack in the bass for my personal preference, but a mild tune with a digital EQ can get the slam I prefer. Highly recommend for easy listening and the price to performance is hard to beat.",
        "These are incredible headphones. They have a rich and vibrant sound with deep punchy bass and precise crisp highs. They are lightweight and comfortable to wear; I can wear for them long binge-watch sessions as well as extended music listening. They do benefit from some breaking in and maybe a bit of tweaking in a program like Peace or Voicemeter to tune the levels.\n\nMy favorite part of these headphones is how lightweight and comfortable they are when wearing them for long periods of time as well as the overall sound quality. The closed backs provide an excellent soundscape while maintaining privacy and accentuating the punch of the bass.\n\nThese are clear, precise, and get loud with ease ( I use them with a Fios amp).\n\nI would definitely recommend these headphones for someone seeking a premium, fantastic sounding, comfortable pair of headphones.",
        "Ok so I don't use audiophile terms really, alot of them I'm not sure if I really even understand haha. I do own several headphones, somewhere around 50ish over the ears. I run them off my phone with a fiio a3 or I run them off my Yamaha home stereo receiver hooked to a liquid spark amp. Very modest indeed. The only details I'll get into besides sound is comfort because looks and build speak for them selves, they're awesome. The comfort is perfect, once on your head you forget they are even there. Unlike the jaw breaking force of the Sennheisers. Or the super loose fit of say the sph9500. Ok so now on to the sound!\n\nSOUND PART OF MY REVIEW: as I said, I don't really use alot of audiophile terms I am better at understanding sound by comparison to other headphones or speakers. So at $200 to $300 bucks you have some real heavy hitters. You have alot of great options. To name a few of them I'm guessing you either own or are trying to decide from. You have the Sennheisers 58x, 6xx, 600 and 650. You've also got the likes of hifiman 400i and 4xx the Phillips Fidelio x2hr and the Beyer 770,880,990 just to name a few I foolishly own over 3/4 of these so I feel as if I can speak with pretty good knowledge of what you can expect. So the star of the show, THE BASS! These to me have the best/most bass of the lot. Sub bass is great, snappy drum bass is great, low end grunt from guitars and other stringed instruments is awesome. Mid range is very warm and cozy with very little bass bleed, which is amazing for how much thump these have. The mids are only rivaled by the 58x and 600 variants. I cannot honestly say which is better they're just two different flavors but both equally delicious. The meze is warm and extremely present mixed with Bass where as the Sennheisers are getting very present with much less warrants from bass but so extremely accurate it's almost a religious experience lol. Now the high-end is where things become very difficult. The 99s do not offer the high quality antalitical effortless hight end of the Sennheisers or the planar hifimans but what you get in return is a rolled off super sweet relaxing hight end. Like a very good vinyl pressing compared to a CD if you will. So overall if you want accurate amazing time tested reference sound go with the Sennheisers, if you want hard to drive bassless but very good mids and highs go with hifiman. If you want overall performer with strong v shaped sound and amazing soundstage get the x2s. If your like me and love your bass, and want amazing mids, soundstage and comfort with easy on the ear treble get these meze 99 classic or neo! If I could only have one of these headphones it would be a real hard choice between the 58x and these meze 99s but I'm pretty sure I would take the meze 99. Best bass, best looks, best out of the box accessories and easiest to drive (nothing more than a cellphone required) I hope I was able to give something of an idea of what to expect from these.",
        "SOUND: I've had these headphones for almost a year now. When I was shopping for headphones, I wanted something with a warm sound signature and good bass. I am very treble sensitive and these headphones have the perfect sound signature. I listen to a lot of synth-pop and EDM, music sounds fun and exciting. The bass doesn't 'slam', it's more about the sub-bass which I feel are these headphone's bread and butter.\n\nGAMING: Very cinematic in games and sounds really good especially in single-player games. However, because these are closed back headphones I don't think the sound stage is great, it can feel a bit 'cramped', and these probably aren't the best for FPS games.\n\nCOMFORT: Unfortunately, I don't find these as comfortable as other folks claim. Even after stretching these out there is still a noticeable clamp and adjusting them can be uncomfortable. The cord is awful and splits very close to your neck and there is no way to adjust it; I find the cord frequently rubbing up against my neck and it's very irritating. The pads can become hot and sweaty; I actually bought memory foam pads to replace them because the stock ones are so bad, but unfortunately the memory foam ruined the sound signature of these headphones. I usually wear my headphones all day but I frequently find myself taking these off whenever I can and is a big reason I'm looking to replace these even though I love the sound signature.\n\nOverall, these headphones sport a warm, bass heavy sound signature that sounds great for music and single-player games, but it's limited sound-stage and closed-back nature can make it feel cramped and not good for FPS games. While I adore the sound signature, if comfort is a big concern you may be disappointed.",
        "Si bien son un poco caros, son audifonos premium de alta calidad con un sonido increible, no se sienten pesados, las almohadillas son comodas incluso durante largas sesiones de uso, la diadema es de buena calidad y se extiende bastante. Totalmente recomendados.",

        "These headphones are not bass cannons by any means. Reviewers saying these are bass heavy are probably used to very flat sounding audiophile headphones. If all you care about is the amount of muddy bass then go with a pair of Sony MDRXB's. Where these headphones excel is the ability to deliver great clear bass that isn't muddy, as well as crystal clear vocals. They sound very good out of the box but I would recommend an external Amp or DAC that has bass controls on it as it does improve the sound quality. The soundstage is better than most consumer headphones in this price range but not as good as the DT 770 Pro, however these do not have any of the harsh treble that the DT 770 has which can be ear-piercing at times, and they have much better bass.\n\nThe headphones are the most comfortable headphones I have ever worn. They are even comfortable when wearing glasses. The clamping force isn't very tight so they would not be the best pair of headphones to walk down the street with on. They also have good passive noise isolation but not great as they don't clamp on your head too tight.\n\nThe materials all feel very premium. The leather on the earcups is very nice to the touch and feels much better than leather earcups on other headphones in the same price range.\n\nThe included hard-shell case looks great and doesn't feel cheap by any means. It is a tad larger than other headphone cases however this makes it very easy to put them in the case or take them out on the fly which I prefer.\n\nThe mic quality is good but not great. I have $50 earbuds that have a better microphone than these but they are still good enough for phone/video calls and I have never had anyone on the other end complaint that they couldn't hear me.\n\nI had an issue with my headphones when they arrived. One of the earpads had been damaged in the shipping process and wouldn't stay on the earcup. Customer support was very quick to fix the issue and offered to ship me new earpads, and entirely new headset, as well as compensation which I was not expecting from a premium headphone manufacturer. A+ customer support from a small vendor.\n\nI would recommend these headphones if:\n-You listen to a wide variety of music which includes bass heavy tracks as well as more vocal focused music.\n-You will mainly be using these headphones while stationary such as at a desk.\n-You want comfortable headphones you can wear all day.\n-You want to enjoy your music and not analyze every note.\n\nI would not recommend these headphones if you only listen to one genre of music or need exceptional passive noise isolation.",
        "Jamais entendu un son aussi naturel de cette qualit\u00e9, avec en prime des bonnes basses !!! Et que dire du confort, gr\u00e2ce au double arceau on ne le ressent absolument pas sur sa t\u00eate !! Gros coup de c\u0153ur",
        "",
        "What can I say these are amazing, you hear things in the music that you don\u2019t hear from cheaper headphones.\n\nI use AirPods for convenience and when I want to sit down and just listen to music I use these. I currently just use Apple Music with the highest quality possible and just plugged in to my phone. I do plan on getting an amp but I\u2019m debating whether they can sound better.\n\nAnyway I am very happy with these.",
        "Os contar\u00e9 mi experiencia de c\u00f3mo y porqu\u00e9 llegu\u00e9 a escoger estos auriculares, los Meze 99, y cu\u00e1l es mi opini\u00f3n sobre ellos, porque personalmente a la hora de gastarme esta cantidad de dinero me gusta estar lo m\u00e1s seguro que puedo de mi compra y las opiniones detalladas me son de gran ayuda a la hora de decidir, aunque la mayor\u00eda de las que le\u00ed se centraban casi \u00fanicamente en la calidad de sonido y creo que hay otros aspectos importantes a la hora de escoger unos auriculares que te tienen que durar mucho tiempo. As\u00ed que procurar\u00e9 no dejarme nada y ser totalmente sincero.\n\nAntes que nada, al comprar unos auriculares hay que tener muy claro el uso que les vas a dar y el presupuesto del que dispones. Tambi\u00e9n evaluar si los quieres con cable o bluetooth (se dice que con el bluetooth pierden informaci\u00f3n de sonido). En mi caso buscaba unos auriculares que me permitieran disfrutar de una experiencia inmersiva, pues los usar\u00eda principalmente en el autob\u00fas. Por este motivo me decant\u00e9 por unos de diadema circumaurales (los que envuelven toda la oreja. Existen tambi\u00e9n los intraurales, que son los peque\u00f1os que te metes dentro del o\u00eddo, y los supraurales, que son de diadema pero no cubren toda la oreja), pues suelen dar m\u00e1s calidad de sonido y me parecen m\u00e1s c\u00f3modos.\nMi presupuesto era de 200 euros aprox. como m\u00e1ximo.\n\nEn casa tengo unos Beyerdynamic DT990 Pro que utilizo para edici\u00f3n de audio. Estos dan una calidad de sonido excelente y neutro y cumplen su funci\u00f3n a la perfecci\u00f3n dentro del estudio, pero necesitaba ahora unos cascos vers\u00e1tiles y de uso m\u00e1s l\u00fadico, no para editar sino para disfrutar de m\u00fasica de distintos g\u00e9neros en cualquier parte, y los Beyerdynamic no eran recomendables para llevar a la calle por varios motivos:\n\u2022Tienen una impedancia muy alta (si desconoces qu\u00e9 es la impedancia, vale la pena informarse) de 250ohms, y por lo tanto a la hora de escuchar m\u00fasica desde el m\u00f3vil se oye muy flojo; necesitan ser conectados a la tarjeta de sonido que tengo en casa (existen tambi\u00e9n amplificadores port\u00e1tiles) para sacarle todo su potencial. Por lo tanto necesitaba unos con una impedancia baja.\n\u2022Son auriculares semi-abiertos, es decir, no a\u00edslan el sonido exterior. En mi caso eso es una pega por que en el bus molestas a los otros pasajeros. Del mismo modo tambi\u00e9n oyes al beb\u00e9 llor\u00f3n del asiento delantero. Por lo tanto necesitaba unos de cerrados (que tambi\u00e9n me servir\u00edan a la hora de grabar voces).\n\u2022Tienen un cable exageradamente largo, pues est\u00e1n pensados para utilizar en estudio, pero fuera de \u00e9l es un contra pues necesitas algo portable y pr\u00e1ctico. Por lo tanto necesitaba unos con cable ligero y extra\u00edble.\n\nAdem\u00e1s, hay otros aspectos a tener en cuenta que, despu\u00e9s de mirar diversas listas de mejores cascos, no he visto.\nEstos aspectos son:\n\u2022Que se puedan quitar las almohadillas, pues al cabo de un tiempo se ensucian y hay que lavarlas.\n\u2022Que el cable sea de quita y pon, para reemplazarlo si se rompe o poder intercambiarlo por otro m\u00e1s largo o corto seg\u00fan te convenga.\n\u2022Que sean ergon\u00f3micos para pod\u00e9rtelos poner en el cuello.\n\u2022Que tengan una buena funda para que no se rompan en el transporte del uso diario.\n\nOtras caracter\u00edsticas que para m\u00ed tambi\u00e9n son importantes son el dise\u00f1o y los materiales de construcci\u00f3n.\n\nComo es l\u00f3gico es muy dif\u00edcil encontrar unos cascos que cumplan tantos requisitos. A\u00fan as\u00ed, hice una b\u00fasqueda intensiva durante varios d\u00edas, y me decid\u00ed por los Audio Technica M50x (que tambi\u00e9n tienen la versi\u00f3n en bluetooth), del que le\u00ed innumerables rese\u00f1as positivas. As\u00ed que fui a probarlos a mi tienda habitual y me sorprendi\u00f3 lo incre\u00edblemente malos que eran: inc\u00f3modos, se escuchaban de pena, (adem\u00e1s de bastante feos y constru\u00eddos enteramente en pl\u00e1stico, cosas que ya sab\u00eda pero podia sacrificar en pro de lo otro que supuestamente ten\u00eda).\n\nAs\u00ed que me puse de nuevo a buscar y a leer opiniones y encontr\u00e9 unos auriculares que me atrajeron de entrada por su particular dise\u00f1o: los Meze 99. Vi tambi\u00e9n que se pod\u00eda quitar el cable (algo de lo que disponen muy pocos modelos), que ten\u00edan una impedancia asombrosamente baja (26ohms) y aunque eran de una marca hasta entonces desconocida para m\u00ed, hab\u00eda muy buenas rese\u00f1as.\nMe gustaron mucho pues era el \u00fanico modelo que cumpl\u00eda con todo lo que buscaba, pero no lo ten\u00edan en mi tienda de confianza as\u00ed que me arriesgu\u00e9 y los compr\u00e9 sin probarlos previamente. Aunque los Classic me flipan, al final me qued\u00e9 con el Neo por ser 100 euros m\u00e1s barato y tambi\u00e9n es atractivo (lo compr\u00e9 en enero 2021 por 200 euros).\n\nEscribo todo esto pues, despu\u00e9s de un mes de haberlos adquirido y probado regularmente. He de confesar que me han sorprendido gratamente. Mis espectativas ya eran altas, pero al abrir su cuidada caja, ver su elegante funda r\u00edgida y descubrir unos cascos que se ven fant\u00e1sticos (est\u00e1n tremendos y se palpa calidad cuando los sostienes) con sus acabados met\u00e1licos, me qued\u00e9 realmente sorprendido. Adem\u00e1s del cable y la funda, incluye un adaptador jack.\n\nSu calidad de sonido es buena si la comparo con los Beyerdynamic, que son una bestia. No soy un entendido en la materia pero no creo que exageren ninguna frecuencia; estan bastante equilibrados.\nDestaco que, como otros cascos cerrados que he probado, al cabo de una hora larga de escucha, tienes que quit\u00e1rtelos un rato pues te empiezan a molestar las orejas.\nTambi\u00e9n quiero comentar que me los enviaron en su caja original, sin ning\u00fan otro envoltorio que la cubriera, y se podr\u00edan haber da\u00f1ado f\u00e1cilmente durante el transporte, cosa que por suerte no pas\u00f3. No se si esto es cosa de amazon, del propio fabricante o de la compa\u00f1ia de reparto.\n\nEn caso de que le encontrara pegas en un futuro reeditar\u00eda esta rese\u00f1a, pero se los ve resistentes, un objeto al que probablemente le coger\u00e9 cari\u00f1o y me acompa\u00f1ar\u00e1 durante muchos a\u00f1os.",

        "I use these headphones to work around the house, I use them at the gym to work out, and I use them while I'm doing lawn work.\n\nThe battery life on these headphones is extraordinary. The quality is very high, given the price point. I would easily put these up against most, way more expensive, headphones in both sound and performance.\n\nThe rechargeable case is a really cool feature. It uses USB-C, which I really like. The outward display is excellent. The battery life is extremely long and the quality of the headphones is very good for ear bud style headphones.\n\nThe range of the Bluetooth is phenomenal. I can get around my entire double lot without breaking up. Additionally, the option to charge the case via USB-C or a wireless charger is a really great feature.\n\nThese headphones were easy to pair with any Bluetooth device and quickly adapt to whatever media you're feeding to them.\n\nFrom a person who has owned very expensive wireless headphones in the $200 to $300 range, I would happily buy multiple sets of these headphones in lieu of buying one very expensive set.\n\nAs far as style and comfort goes, these are some of the most comfortable earbuds I've ever worn. They fit very nicely around the ear and they come with a few different attachments so you can change the size of the earbud for maximum comfort. The quality of the sleeves are very high and the fit is very nice. It is very soft and smooth material.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend these to anyone who is an avid listener of podcasts or music on any device and frequently uses headphones to not disturb those around them. These headphones do a great job at canceling outside noise and have a fantastic audio quality to them, especially given their price point. The sleek black design of these with very clear indicator lights makes them as aesthetically pleasing as they are comfortable. The case is very smooth and feels like frosted glass with a clear charging indicator on the front to check the remining capacity of the device. Also much to my surprise the headphones were at 94% charge when they arrived .\n\nOverall, this is just a great product and I would highly recommend it",

        "So far I really like these earbuds. They were extremely easy to connect via Bluetooth on my phone and no other set up besides that was needed. immediately after I took the plastic tabs off of each earbud it began charging from the precharged case that they came in. I really like how the case can be charged via USB and that it gives you a read out on how charged the earbuds are. Using the earbuds they do have quite a bit of bass and the volume can get decently high which I love. I also like that in total there are 3 different sizes on the ear piece part that goes into the ear. So that if the size that comes with it is too big or small you can try these out to get a better fit for your individual ear. I have tried out at least 3 other different types of wireless earbuds and these so far seem to be my favorite just because of the increased base and volume. They also seem to fit comfortably around my ear and don't wiggle too much. I plan to try them out while on a jog and I think they will actually do pretty well. The charging case really is pretty cool. the wireless earbuds snap into place magnetically so that if you have it open in your purse they don't just fall right out and mingle with everything else inside of your purse. The instruction manual is very simple and easy to read it even gives a great grid to refer back to for how to use the button on the wireless earbud. I do wish that it had a separate button for volume increase and volume decrease but so far the button seems to work OK for everything that it needs. Because the earbuds have a primary and secondary designation the batteries are different for each. The battery of the primary earbud dies faster than that of the secondary earbud which is normal. If you get a call on your phone while you're using the earbuds you have the option to answer it with one click or you can reject it with a long click. I really like the company that makes these. I have bought several different models from them and like them all. Very affordable. Considering getting my husband a pair. The manual says that they will stayed paired for up to 33 feet from your phone. They will stay charged for 8-10 hours. It only takes 2 hours to fully charge them on the case. It takes 3 hours for the case to recharge itself. Love how you can be mobile and charge these while out and about.",
        "I've purchased previous headphones from this same company and each time I\u2019m very impressed with their quality. This time, I\u2019m really loving these new headphones because I can use this to speak to friends on the phone while listen to music at the same time.\n\nOkay now, before you read on you need to understand. I wasn't looking for an awesome listening experience. I was looking for a inexpensive set that would produce sound at a level that still makes them useful while flying. I needed something that would last, sound great and have great quality.\n\nThe outside case:\nSmall enough to fit into your pocket or handbag. There is an indicator on the outside that tells you how much battery life is remaining which is so cool and it will constantly charge your headphones when placed within the case. The lid is kept close with a small magnet, which is a nice thought. Unless your trying to close it without making any noise as the mentioned magnet loves to make it close with a very noticeable snap. Charging is very simple and the lights indicating the battery level makes knowing whats going on very easy.\n\nThe buds:\nThey fit nicely, pairing was incredibly easy to complete and they do connect pretty much flawlessly every time they are taken out of the case. They sound great overall. You can control the volume and pause what your watching / listening to on the buds by placing your finger on the right spot.\n\nWith all of that said, if your looking for a set of buds that will give you the performance then it's worth checking out. These are a great budget set that preforms like a budget set."

        "Head phones work great super comfortable and battery lasts forever! my only complaint is that the volume of my device and the headphone volume adjuster are separate so it can be difficult to keep a good volume",
        "Love the head phones, they have a long charge and they are great with blocking out back ground noise",
        "The sound quality is great and the headphones are very comfortable and durable, for the most part. I started using these september year ago, and they worked great and still do in terms of audio. However, as of these past few months, the headphones have had some issues. The outer coating of the headphone padding has started to peel and shed off, leaving black specks on my face and neck. Additionally, the max charge has been steadily falling for a couple of months. Before, I could wake up early, fall asleep with them on, and wake up in the morning without them being on low battery. However, it has gradually dropped to about 18 hours, and today, they were only able to hold a charge for 13 hours. Again, these have seen pretty much daily use from me and have seen some rather unfavorable conditions (nothing too bad, just some light sprinkles and I don't believe water got inside), so this may just be a result of constant use. Maybe not a good choice for long term use, but other than that, I am very satisfied with these",
        "I have been using these for about 5 months, and I am really happy. I find them to be comfortable, decent sound protection, and overall good listening. I keep them charged and in 1-2 hours have never lost power or noticed decreased sound.",
        "They do not cancel all the outside noise but enough that i don't notice it. Sound is surprisingly good considering that I have some hearing loss. Blutooth connects quickly and volumn is easy to set. The earpads are also comfortable which is a big plus for me as I find most to become uncomfortable after just a short time.",
        "The se headphones are effective and give me a great sound for books or music. helpful on airplanes and around house while working. They connected easily to my Bluetooth systems.",
        "When I excitingly opened my box I didn't even bother to see or read anything just took the headphones out. Unsynched my Cowin E7 from my phone and added these. I noticed right away the E7 logo on the side and was like what the heck is this? I grabbed my old pair and was like. Umph whatever.\n\nI put them on and felt a bit off. But again thinking its because they are new silly goose. As you can see from my pictures, I USED AND ABUSED MY COWINS! I make music and they were a downgrade from my JVCs which I had for years. I bought my Cowins in 2019 I believe maybe sooner. I love them. I was shocked at the bass and the clarity of my music, other music and movies alike. They are perfect for the $50 I slapped down vs the $200 for my pair prior.\n\nWell needless to say the sound quality on these are trash in my opinion. I was listening to a song and was like this really isn't right. So I like the genius I am not, put both pairs on and decided to switch back and force between the two during different parts of the song to compare and yeah they don't live up.\n\nThe bass is weak which is a no go for me. The Cowins always had the bass on point so when I plugged into other sources like speakers and my car it was not too much nor too weak. These new E7 I can tell you right now if I don't remember every time to mix correctly will have the bass way too deep every single time. Drawing out other components most likely.\n\nEven trying to watch a movie they are not as loud as my Cowins. I used the hold them side by side and crank it up test. I use to get stopped and stared at on the train, bus or walking, \"Those are seriously loud \ud83d\ude10\" \"Dang those are some good headphones\" \"How are those so loud?\" \"I can hear every word of what your listening to\" are just some of the comments/compliments I have gotten over the years. I do not think I will be getting the same reaction from these E7s.\n\nI'm super saddened by this as I'm seeing the old versions are no longer available. And it sucks. There's nothing wrong with my cowins except they are very stretched out and as you can see the ear covers are just decimated. I think I'm going to gift my son with these new ones as he just uses them to game mostly.\n\nI'm really really sad you guys. Like pressed about this. Those Cowins were perfection. What the heck happened? I'm again really sad I didn't buy 12 of them sooner to be prepared for the dreadful day they stop working on me. I just don't want to think about it.\n\nDid I mention I'm sad?",
        "I\u2019m autistic and I suffer from sensory overload. These headphones have completely changed my life, I wear them every single day and never leave the house without them. They\u2019re comfortable, they\u2019re effective, they take the edge off the noise without shutting me out entirely, they stay connected for hours at a time, the battery lasts for days, the sound quality is great, I could go on and on. By far one of the best headphones you could possibly get for the price. I bought another pair three years ago, the only reason I had to replace them was because I wore them so much the faux leather started peeling off. No other part of the headphones stopped working, just the leather. I got the warranty this time around, so I never have to worry about it again.",

The craftsmanship quality is great, and it\u2019s so nice to be able to adjust the bass with the slide of your finger depending on what you\u2019re doing. They also come with a nice travel carrying bag, and the quick charge feature is so nice to have when you're on the run. Setup to my iPhone took less than 15 seconds with just one push of a button. I\u2019d definitely recommend this product to those looking for quality headphones.",
        "I been wanting some over the ear headphones and decided to go with these because I'm a bass lover. These feel and are premium quality. Connecting to Bluetooth is super easy and the app also has a few settings that you can adjust for your preference. After hooking up I put on a song that I know has bass and I let it rip. When I say these sound good even in high bass, it's an understatement. These are the most fun headphones you can get and for the price you can't compete. From now on I will make sure I get a set every other year.",
        "This is my pick of the year! Maybe the century!\n\nI am both Autistic, and also a little biased.\n\nI had the previous generation skull crushers. The left side broke, and skull candy replaced them in warranty for free.\n\nI wore those replacement headphones for about four more years until the bass slider started acting up.\n\nSo when it came time to by a new pair, it was between these and the ANC model. The ANC model was about 100 dollars more, and I\u2019m not a big fan of ANC\u2019s because they usually have a high pitched hiss whenever there\u2019s no noise coming through.\n\nI was super happy when I found the non-ANC model. Because they were cheaper and most closely resembled my old pair.\n\nThe bass is just a touch stronger than the last generation. Highs and mids are nice too.\n\nI really like the bass slider, because anything with a muddy baseline, you can turn down. Also anytime you are listening to an audible book, if the voice is low, you can turn the bass down.\n\nAll in all I would buy these again.\n\nI have recommended to several friends, some Autistic, some not. Everyone that tries them wants a pair and are really excited they are so affordable.",
        "I like these . They really seal to your ears & the sound is nice. However the volume is not all that much. In my opinion the volume could be louder. Thes are however easy to link to Bluetooth & stay linked. Easy to use. Thank you Amazon.",
        "These are extremely comfortable, easy to pack, and the buttons are easy to press and use to connect to different devices. The battery life is INCREDIBLY long and the sound is absolutely incredible from one song to the next. The Quality of the Noise Cancellation is really next level, but not advisable for people, mainly kids or people who are not stationary or in a safe place to use in public. The only reason being that it can block out many or ALL voices that could be trying to get their attention or warn them of obstacles. Thats why I only use these at home, in a vehicle I\u2019m not driving, or when I am doing a solo housekeeping job so I am aware of all the tools I am using.",
        "I wear them mostly to the gym but also at home the sound is amazing the battery life is actually crazy and there so comfortable only thing I noticed is they do slide off a bit when I do certain exercises but that's as expected overall best headphones I've every purchased",
        "Overall I am very pleased with these headphones. I'm not super knowledgeable or picky on sound details so I cannot give a super techy sounding review. That being said if you're a normal person that is just looking for a solid pair of headphones that aren't overpriced these are great. I mainly got these for the gym which they are great for because of the bass. They are not the noise cancelling version so don't get them and write a bad review because of that because you'll look ridiculous. haha. Again very pleased which has been my general experience with skull candy and the extra charging cable thrown in is a nice touch. Well done skull candy.",
        "I've owned the first wireless Crushers and now the Crusher Evo. Like a lot of reviews describe it, they're absolutely fun to use. If you're one of those people who has never owned a Skullcandy product - the 'Crusher bass' is not simply a equalizer bass boost that other headphone companies offer. There's a physical slider on the left headphone earcup right below the orange button. Sliding this upwards increases the vibrations generated by physical components within the headphone itself. You absolutely have to try it on maximum strength on some bass heavy music --- it will literally make your head rattle.\n\nMy personal favourite is watching movies on my ipad with the Crushers. Try out some bass heavy movies like Michael Bay film, flight scenes from Top Gun Maverick, or the ending sequence of Avengers Endgame and you'll understand what I mean. And don't even get me started on playing games with the Crusher Evos --- absolutely mind blowing :)\n\nFor the price you pay for Crusher Evos, they're definitely worth the value compared to other brands at the same price. I also use Tile for my keys/wallet at home, so having that feature built into the headphones is nice. There's also an app that you can download to your phone that allows you to further tweak the audio profile for optimal hearing.\n\nOverall, an awesome product and highly recommended to anyone looking for having a little skull-shaking fun with their movies/music."

        "My daughter\u2019s been using these for her online classes, and they\u2019ve been perfect. The microphone is clear enough that her teachers hear her without any trouble, and the soft ear pads mean she doesn\u2019t fuss about wearing them. The volume limiter puts me at ease, knowing her hearing is protected. We\u2019ve even used them on a road trip, and they paired easily with both the tablet and my phone. They fold up nicely too, saving space in her backpack.",
        "Bought these for my niece\u2019s birthday, and they\u2019re a hit. She\u2019s tough on tech, but these headphones have stood up to the test. They\u2019re light, so she barely notices them on her head, and the volume limiter means I don\u2019t worry about her blasting music too loudly. Plus, they lasted through a whole weekend of use without needing a charge, which is a win in any parent\u2019s book.",

        "We travel frequently, and these Kids Bluetooth Headphones have become a must-have for our trips. They're incredibly lightweight and compact, making them easy to pack. My daughter loves them for watching movies and playing games on her tablet during flights. They're comfortable enough for her to wear during long class sessions, and the microphone clarity is excellent for participating in discussions. The volume limiter is a key feature for me, ensuring her ears are protected during prolonged use. The volume limiter is fantastic for keeping the sound at a safe level. The long battery life is a lifesaver on long trips, and they recharge quickly at our stops. The microphone is a great addition for when she wants to chat with friends. These headphones have made our travels much more enjoyable for her and quieter for us!",
        "The sound quality is fine (I wore it to the gym for a workout and it wasn't so bad that I couldn't hear my music) and there haven't been any issues with it suddenly disconnecting either. These aren't noise cancelling but they're good for if you're on a walk, doing some work in public, or anything where you would still want to be aware of your surroundings. The battery life is also pretty good as my baby sister managed to get a full 2 weeks of using these at school for her classes. My only issue is that it is actually quite hard to connect it to a device for the first time. Even with the instructions it took about 4 tries so it's easier to just use the cord it comes with.",

        "As a parent, I'm always concerned about my kids' hearing, and these headphones address that worry perfectly. The volume limiter is exactly what I was looking for. My kids use them for watching their favorite shows and listening to music, and the sound quality is just right for their young ears. They're so lightweight and comfortable; my kids forget they're wearing them. The battery life is another huge bonus \u2013 they last for days on a single charge. They're also really comfortable, which is important for my kids who wear them for extended periods. The battery life is fantastic \u2013 it seems like they rarely need charging.They've been great for keeping the kids entertained on rainy days and during quiet time.",

        "As a mom working from home, finding quiet time can be challenging. They are so lightweight and comfortable that he wears them while doing his online learning and watching his favorite shows. The volume limiting feature is fantastic - I don't have to constantly monitor the volume to ensure his hearing isn't at risk. The battery life is impressive. We charge them once, and he's set for the week. The over-ear design also does a great job of blocking out external noise, which helps him focus, especially during his virtual classes. The microphone is a plus for his interactive learning sessions. He feels like a little professional taking calls with it. The wireless feature means he can move around freely without getting tangled up. They've also been a lifesaver on car rides and during my Zoom meetings. I can focus on my work knowing he's happily engaged. These headphones have not only helped him with his activities but have also brought some much-needed quiet to our home. They've really improved the way we manage our daily routines.",
        "The headphones are comfortable and fit well . Very simple and easy to use. The blue tooth connectivity was very quick. The sound quality is good. These headphones have survived a few throws to the ground. Downside is that there are no volume toggles on the headphones themselves. They are also good as wired headphones.",
        "I got these for his Ipad and he loves them the ear cushions are soft and connected to the Ipad easily comes with a charger and a connection cord if you have to plug it into your media stuff so great for airplanes ! and they don\u2019t seem flimsy see how they hold up with my 4 year old.",

        "I recently purchased these Open Ear Headphones and I'm incredibly impressed with their performance across various activities. Here's my detailed review highlighting the pros and cons:\n\n**Pros:**\n1. **Immersive Stereo Sound:** The 16.2mm drivers deliver rich and immersive audio, making every beat crystal clear, whether you're working out, gaming, or simply enjoying music.\n2. **Innovative Open Ear Design:** I love the open ear concept! It allows me to stay aware of my surroundings while enjoying music, ensuring safety during outdoor activities.\n3. **Bluetooth 5.3 Connectivity:** The Bluetooth 5.3 technology provides a stable and seamless connection with my devices, allowing me to move freely without worrying about signal drops.\n4. **Noise-Cancellation Mic:** The noise-cancellation mic ensures clear calls even in noisy environments, making it ideal for work calls and catching up with friends and family.\n5. **Long Battery Life:** With an impressive 45 hours of playtime, these earbuds keep up with my active lifestyle without constantly needing a recharge.\n6. **Comfortable Fit:** The earbuds are lightweight and ergonomically designed, providing a comfortable fit even during extended wear.\n7. **Versatile Usage:** Perfect for sports, workouts, gaming, and everyday use, these headphones are incredibly versatile and cater to all my audio needs.\n\n**Cons:**\n1. **Limited Bass:** While the sound quality is excellent, the bass could be slightly stronger for a more immersive audio experience, especially for bass enthusiasts.\n2. **Not Fully Noise-Isolating:** The open ear design allows ambient sound, which is great for safety but might not be ideal for users seeking complete noise isolation in noisy environments.\n\nIn summary, these Open Ear Headphones are a game-changer for anyone with an active lifestyle. The combination of immersive sound, open ear design, and long battery life makes them a top choice for sports, workouts, and gaming enthusiasts. While there are minor drawbacks, the overall performance and versatility make these earbuds a fantastic investment. Highly recommended!",
        "I was looking for earbuds that didn\u2019t seal my ear canal and that I could listen to my surroundings, and what a great surprise I got with these Truefree O1.\n\nI must say I was a little bit skeptical with the design, they looked a little weird but once you put them on, they feel just great. They\u2019re very lite and comfortable. The fact that they don\u2019t seal the ear canal is very useful, since you can walk or ride a bike or use them at the office and you can still hear what\u2019s going on around you. Sound is decent, first because the driver is pretty large, but bass is not too powerful, mids and highs are nice, so for the casual music listener or for hearing podcasts or audio books they\u2019re really good, for the hard core music listener, these aren\u2019t the best option. Takes a little bit of time to get used to find the touch controls but no big deal.\n\nThe case is rather large but is understandable because of the design of the earbuds. Connecting to the phone is a breeze and they connect really fast just by opening the case. Battery life is awesome, I got almost 10 hours in a single charge.\n\nThese are great for the price and for daily use when you need to be aware of what\u2019s going on in your surroundings, just don\u2019t expect HiFi since these earbuds push the sound to your ears instead on injecting it inside your ear. Great value for the price.",
        "These headphones make for a good option if you want open air pass-through sound. Theses headphones serve a specific purpose; if you want to be able to hear what's around you while listening to music. Ideally this is great for working out or running if you want to be able to hear cars as you're running on the side of the road for safety, these are it! You have to know that going into purchasing headphones like this because you can't expect the same booming quality sound with headphones like this that you would get out of in ear buds. That being said the sound quality is good it serves its purpose for listening to music. The bass is lacking, but that's to be expected. These feel pretty light around my ears not cumbersome. Did bot get uncomfortable after a few hours of wear I was able to run with them And they didn't fall out of place. It comes with a USB a to USB-C charger cord. Thumbs up for going USBC. Connection to my phone was incredibly easy It took no time at all and they came fully charged out of the box. The carrying case however is pretty large as you can see in the picture but these are also larger style buds that wrap around your ear so the case needs to fit a larger object. I wouldn't stick this case in my pocket to walk around with bc of the size, but perfect fit for a backpack or purse or small carrying crossbody bag. Definitely recommend if you're looking for an open ear style headphone. Battery life is solid with ab 10hrs on the headphones and another 45hrs from the case.",

        "These headphones are excellent value for the money. I tend to use headphones while at work, sometimes for many hours. I have always found it hard to find good sounding headphones / earbuds that are comfortable for lond periods of time, while being able to hear sounds around me. These are excellent! They are very comfortable, and feel kind of like you are wearing glasses. Even with many movements they don't fall off. The sound quality is very good, with good highs, mids, good base (There is a very slight lack in base, but it is very minimal). I really like that there is nothing in going directly in your ear. I feel that it is healthier for your ears, and also isn't gross to share headphones with someone else. I alos take many calls on my headphones (including business calls) so a good microphone is essential. The microphone on these is excellent. I highly recommend these headphones!\n\nThe only thing that could be considered a negative point, is the case is pretty big compared to other brands. It has to be larger to accomodate this style. The benefit is there is lots of battery power so they last a long time. However they aren't great fitting in your pocket for long times. But itn't a big deal, compared to all the good aspects of these headphones.",
        "Con gusto comparto mis puntos de vista y opinion sobre este par de auriculares de la marca truefree que son el modelo 01... primero que nada me sorprende lo comodos que son ya que puedes traerlos puestos por horas y en ningun momento molestan, son muy pero muy comodos y al ser cero intrusivos en los conductos auditivos de las orejas pues eso hace precisamente que sean muy comodos; ahora bien al estar viendo las especificaciones uno puede constatar que cuentan con un driver ENORME el cual hace bastante bien su trabajo y adicionalmente el contar con el codec de audio LDAC pues que mas podria decir, la calidad del audio entregada es muy bella pues se notan matices en la musica que no se lograrian notar con codecs de audio no tan especializados en ello asi que aqui tienen un gran punto a su favor, los tonos altos son cristalinos y bien manejados no calan en los oidos y son muy perceptibles, los tonos medios bien traidos al frente y los tonos bajos si bien no es su punto mas fuerte aun asi se hacen presente de una buena forma bien desenvueltos; obvio para todo ello siempre recomiendo \"jugar\" con los diferentes tipos de ecualizaciones que disponga su equipo ya sea celular o tables o laptop dependiendo para que los vayas a usar.\nOtro excelente beneficio es que soportan dos dispositivos emparejados en este par de auriculares lo cual se agradece mucho y es facil conmutar entre ambos.\nel volumen creo yo es el punto menos fuerte de estos auriculares pues a mi por ejemplo me gusta llevar el audio a niveles mas altos que los tipicos y pues aqui se quedan un poco cortos en ese aspecto, ahora bien aclaro ojo con esto pues estos auriculares estan dise\u00f1ados y pensados en la seguridad al momento de traerlos puestos ya que son del tipo \"abierto\" y no son de los que entran con gomitas al canal auditivo del oido cosa que ya mencione al inicio, dejando esto bien especificado puedo decir que suenan muy detallado, la separacion de instrumentos es muy pero muy buena notandose matices que no podrias escuchar con auriculares sin LDAC y el volumen aunque no es su punto fuerte creo es lo suficientemente alto para disfrutar andando en la calle ya sea en un paseo en bicileta o patines o trotando o caminando y pues en realidad para ello fueron hecho este par de auriculares por lo que aclarado el punto puedo decir que cumplen perfectamente con su cometido.\ncomo manos libres suenan excelente muy claros en todo aspecto ademas de contar con ENC el cual con la ayuda de sus microfonos elimina muy bien el ruido exterior al momento de estar en modo manos libres lo cual dicho ENC no hay que hacer nada al respecto, se activa de forma automatica en las llamadas.\nel estuche de carga es algo grandecito por lo que no es facil llevarlo en la bolsa del pantalon o pants si andas haciendo ejercicio pero facil de trasportar en mochila o por ejemplo en una cangurera y tiene la capacidad de cargar tus auriculares alrededor de 3 veces mas una vez que agotas la bateria de los mismos la cual vamos a tocar de una vez, los auriculares prometen en promedio 10 horas de actividad pero ojo hay que ser cuidadosos en esto ya que a veces nosotros como usuarios no comprendemos como se mide esto, dichas 10 horas de servicio es a un volumen aproximadamente del 70% y con la conmutacion de LDAC apagada ya que todo ello hace que la bateria se gaste mas rapidamente pero si te gusta traer el volumen a todo lo que da y con LDAC encendido todo el tiempo pues el promedio de tiempo ronda las 6 o 6 y media horas el cual es bastante bueno la verdad como sea muy bien.\ncuentan con un modo de baja latencia para cuando juegas el LAG sea casi imperceptible el cual funciona muy bien tambien y algo que me gusto mucho es que Truefree al ser una compa\u00f1ia hermana de SP pues debo comentar que la aplicacion movil de SP funciona perfectamente bien de hecho al momento de estarlos usando por primera vez me mando una actualizacion del firmware lo cual esta por demas excelente para asi siempre tenerlos actualizados como debe de ser.\nen conclusion estamos ante un paquete bien completo la verdad; buen sonido (muy bueno de hecho), buen desempe\u00f1o, buena autonomia, faciles de emparejar y muy comodos asi que si de verdad estas en busqueda de comprarte este par de auriculares para tus jornadas de ejercicio o simplemente de ocio al ir a caminar la verdad no lo dudes que los vas a disfrutar bastante.\ngracias por llegar hasta aqui y espero te haya servido mi experiencia para si tenias alguna duda pues que haya sido resuelta, excelente dia y felices compras!!!",

After a year and a half, it started to make a pitch sound when you turn them on and leave them for 1 min sitting. The only way to turn off that pitch sound is to press the button for noise cancelation, after that it stops making noise, and works great. C:",

        "She wears them every day, and loves the sound and the quietness. Only negativity is that they are hard to move between devices. Our previous apple AirPods just reconnected between devices automatically. With these, she has to forget the previous device to get them to work on the new one.",
        "Overall the audio quality is pretty good, and active noise canceling is kindof decent (coming from a pair of first generation Surface Headphones).\n\nI'm having a couple of problems that basically make these unusable while they are charging though, and I've forgotten to charge them until they are down to 20% a couple of times now. At 20% the bluetooth starts cutting in and out on the microphone connection, which makes them unusable for meetings. You *can* switch to a wired connection, but (A) as far as I can tell the audio jack has no microphone connection, and (2) if you attempt to charge while using the audio jack to at least listen to things, there is a feedback buzz that occurs. I suppose I can at least switch to wired to listen to stuff while I'm working, but that means it's not charging, and I can't have meetings until it is charged... so... while these work great when they have power, I'm going to have to give this a low rating for actual usability for work purposes.\n\nUpdate: After 2 years of use, these are now refusing to stay connected to my PC, and I have no idea why. They stay connected to other stuff just fine, and other things seem to have no issue staying connected to my PC, but this headset just doesn't want to stay connected for some reason. For $140, I kind of expected them to be better, and last longer than they have. I eventually solved the buzzing issue... but I find, these are still not great for the money.",

I don't know what happened but, somehow, a \u00a370 set of headphones has the loveliness and sound quality of something 5 times more expensive.\n\nSo, my second favourites *were* my Sony WH-1000XM5, which are significantly more expensive, but slightly, sort of, soulless. That will probably sound weird, but they just feel a little lacklustre, somehow. In any case, husband has adopted those and loves them.\n\nWe needed a third pair for when batteries run low (we are both in headphones throughout the day every day) so we plumped for these - something for us to rotate to if and when we needed to recharge our respective old reliables.\n\nAnd they're marvellous! They're comfortable (although, just quickly, I have a smaller head than husband and I think I find them ever so slightly more comfy than he) and the sound quality is fab. The noise cancelling on them is genuinely cancel-y; it makes any external noises sound sort of tinny, and very far away. Marvellous.\n\nThere's a small robot lady that lives inside them that will tell you how your battery's getting on, too, and that's always fun.\n\nThe only downside is they don't come with a case, but they fit my Avantree case perfectly, so they have a home to go to.\n\nAll in all, I love them. Not as much as my beloved Avantrees, but far more than the Sony WH-1000XM5s, which are like 3 times the price.\n\nCannot recommend them highly enough.",

I see they went up to 13.99 which to me is totally fine because they are so worth it. I use these just about every day. The sound is amazing. I was jammin some Toby Mac and it sounds great coming from these.",

Comfortable and i love how it cancels out background noise like AC, noises outside a closed room, and outside noises. Battery lasts a long time too! Charging is quick and no damage has been done in like a year of use.",
        "I previously had the Sony WH-C510 ones but one of the ear sides broke and was hanging off the headpiece. I decided to do a slight upgrade because I enjoy wearing these in public with no audio to help with anxiety. These headphones are nearly 100% noise cancelling before turning them on! They\u2019re much more comfortable than the previous pair and I think they are worth the extra price. Only thing I wish is they came with a hard case but I will be sure to be more careful lol",
        "These headphones have pretty good sound and battery life.\n\nI got these as Refreshed or refurbished (or what ever language was used).\n\nNoise canceling\n(Noise canceling OFF)\nThey do not blockout outside noise very well. First of all I\u2019ve used other Sony over-the-ear and on-ear headphones (without any noise canceling) and other models block out ambient noise slightly better than these headphones do with noise canceling off.\n\nNoise canceling ON\nThe noise canceling is pretty weak on these headphones, but it does work slightly.\n\nHaving said that, I didn\u2019t buy them for the noise canceling feature.\n\nControl Buttons\nI don\u2019t particularly like the buttons on these headphones. It\u2019s not easy to \u201cfeel\u201d the difference between the play/pause button and the volume buttons. I also don\u2019t like them way you click the play button to skip and rewind songs vs a separate toggle button.",
        "I was skeptical about how these would turn out but I was shockingly surprised that they were awesome! High quality sound and comfy fit!",
        "Battery life is phenomenal! However, everything else is subpar. Not very comfortable, hard to store since it doesn't fold and the noise canceling is terrible. I'm fine with the purchase since it was restored and slightly cheaper but I would not buy this at full price.",
        "They\u2019re really comfortable and the noise cancellation is good for the price. these are the first pair of noise canceling headphones i\u2019ve bought and it seems i\u2019ve made the right choice!",
        "These had very good sound and excellent base response. Noise cancelling worked, but since this was my first experience with noise cancellation (NC), I don't really have a good comparison. NC made a pretty big difference when I was doing noisy tasks such as lawn mowing, so I know it worked. Seemed like the bass was increased and highs were more muted with NC on. The Bluetooth worked seamlessly with both my Android phone and tablet. Also takes phone calls well. Overall, a very good product for the price.",
        "As soon as a little sweat get inside them, it shuts off and take days to turn back on or it might not ever turn back on. You probably need to make a pair that are water and sweat proof.",

        "Best headphones I've ever had, great range, and amazing sound with a really good bass boost compared to other earbuds. Great for tough gym sessions, noise cancelation is amazing, and it paired easily with my iPhone. Very comfortable and fits perfectly around the ear. Also, very long battery life compared to other ear buds I have purchased.",
        "I am someone who likes products that are good enough and don't understand how others are willing to pay $200 for a pair of headphones. I am also someone who doesn't want a junk product, just good enough quality at a good enough price. I bought these wireless earphones because I accidentally lost mine. Considering these earphones don't have the trusted brand of a name like Sony or Apple, it's always a bit of a gamble to buy a product that doesn't carry the peace of mind of a well-known big brand name, but it also doesn't carry the high price tag of one of those brands. I am writing this review because I am pleasantly surprised with the overall quality of these earphones. Both the sound quality and the build quality meet or exceed my expectations. The price makes it a great value find. The shape is comfortable for a 1-hour walk, no issues. Battery life seems normal to above normal. I've only had them for a few days but already find them to be better than my previous headphones that I lost. If they were to break or stop working prematurely, I will update this review. But if you're reading this now, that means they are still good.",
        "I have owned more than a dozen types of earbuds including two pairs of Apples. Being a woman, I have smaller ears and I\u2019ve always had difficulty keeping them in my ears when on exercise equipment. These earbuds are so comfortable and stay put, give me amazing quality of sound, awesome noise canceling and the charge seems to last forever. They seem to connect instantly with my device unlike others that I\u2019ve always had to pair up with every use. I\u2019m thrilled, they will be the only ones I ever buy again! Best of all the price can\u2019t be beat.",
        "Sound quality is surprisingly good for the price. Plenty enough bass, but not too much where it takes over. Mids and highs have a good balance. The volume is plenty loud enough to use in noisy environments.\nBut my favorite features are definitely the ear hooks and having physical buttons for the controls.\nThese things stay put far better than the normal style earbuds when doing any kind of physical activity or even eating. And on the infrequent occasion when you do have to readjust these on your ears, you're not constantly accidentally pushing the oversensitive touch controls that most regular earbuds have these days. Starting to get tired of that.\nBattery life is definitely awesome. Lasts a super long time. Far longer than any of my other sets of regular earbuds. I've had these for going on a month now and I'm just charging the case for the first time. Pretty amazing.\nSo yeah, these are definitely worth the price. Hopefully they'll last a while.",
        "One thing I personally don't like about these nowadays is that there's no ear hook. These are so comfortable and you never have to worry about them falling off! I recommend these for great sound quality, comfortability, and compatibility for androids. Excellent product! The battery lasts absolutely forever so don't worry about that either!",
        "I purchased these earbuds because I lost the charging case for a much more expensive set of earbuds and resolved not to throw good money after bad in search of audiophile quality.\n\nPros: the fit of these earbuds is astoundingly good and the over-the-ear hooks are comfortable and better than my high priced buds. These two features alone make this a good purchase. I can comfortably work while wearing them without fear that they will dislodge, and the noise isolation is very good. The sound quality for podcasts is very good. Despite some other negative reviews about the controls, I actually like the physical controls on these buds and find them convenient to use, because I can feel the buttons on the earbuds. I don't know how the battery will hold up, but in the short time that I have owned them the batteries in both the buds and the base have held a good charge.\n\nCons: Read the advertisement carefully: these earbuds do not have active noise-cancelling playback. I blame myself for not reading the advertisement better, and I do like the noise isolation that these earbuds provide, but I could not rate them highly as a \"noise cancelling\" device, at least for playback. The sound quality for music playback is acceptable, given the price point, but the bass gets a muddy fast and there's detectable distortion at higher (but otherwise safe) volume.\n\nBottom line: a solid 4 stars and solid value for my purposes.",
        "LOVE THESE BUDS.. my husband is ill so I have buds in from the time I get up till the time i go to bed.. the battery last all day and then I charge them before bed... the FIT IS AWSOME.. they are not stiff.. very flexible..the sound is great.. compared to the last pair I had I actually had to turn volume down because these buds didn't need to be up that far for good sound...\nthe price was surprising for how these buds perform!! awesome!!",
        "I bought these earbuds to use while traveling and found them to be a very good value and easy to use. Well, not supposed to be sound blocking, I did find them very helpful in blocking noise while flying. I like the feature on the case that shows you the battery life. I recommend them highly.",

        "Ich habe die BX29 als Ersatz f\u00fcr meine verschwundenen JBL Wave 100 Buds gekauft. Ich nutze die Kopfh\u00f6rer haupts\u00e4chlich f\u00fcr H\u00f6rb\u00fccher und zum Telefonieren und f\u00fcr diesen Zweck sind Sie auf jeden Fall top geeignet. Im Vergleich zu den JBL ist die Sprache nat\u00fcrlicher und f\u00fcr mich dadurch besser zu verstehen. Bei Music ist der Bass wenn man die passende Gr\u00f6\u00dfe St\u00f6psel verwendet sehr gut, ich verwende jedoch eine Nummer kleiner um besser die Umwelt um mich herum beim Laufen h\u00f6ren zu k\u00f6nnen, mit den kleineren St\u00f6pseln finde ich die Earbuds auch angenehmer zu tragen. Die JBL (Model ohne B\u00fcgel) mu\u00dfte ich immer ganz fest ins Ohr dr\u00fccken damit sie hielten, die BX29 sitzen dank dem B\u00fcgel auch ohne Druck sehr angenehm und fallen auch nicht heraus. Wobei die B\u00fcgel auch nicht wie bei anderen Bluetooth Headsets die ich schon hatte mit der Brille um den korrekten Sitz konkurieren. Ich hatte zwischendurch \"g\u00fcnstige\" in-ears beim Discounter gekauft, diese waren jedoch f\u00fcr mich praktisch nicht zu gebrauchen.\nPositiv ist mir au\u00dferdem das automatische pairing bei der Entnahme aus der Ladeschale aufgefallen, welches zu den am besten funktionierenden geh\u00f6rt die ich bisher benutzt habe, meine gro\u00dfen Over-Ear ANC Kopfh\u00f6ren k\u00f6nnten sich da eine Scheibe von abschneiden.\nAppropos Noise Canceling: die BX29 haben nur ENC, kein ANC, wer wirklich auf das Noise Canceling angewiesen ist sollte lieber in gro\u00dfe Over-Ear Kopfh\u00f6rer mit guten ANC investieren.\nIch hatte die BX29 extra als ein g\u00fcnstigeres In-Ear Model ausgesucht f\u00fcr dne Fall das diese auch verlohren gehen, w\u00fcrde diese aber auch ansonsten als in-ears jetzt wieder kaufen. Die JBL hatten das doppelte gekostet, eine schlechtere Sprachverst\u00e4ndlichkeit und wesentlich schlechtere Reichweite in der Wohnung.\nJe nach Anwendung habe ich auch noch mehrere andere Kopfh\u00f6rer im Einsatz, aber als kleine, g\u00fcnstige, portable in-ears sind die BX29 wirklich zu empfehlen.",

        "I have had wireless ear buds before, and normally I lose them (they fall out) before they break. These have a useful over-the-ear hook that is very comfortable and ensures they don't fall out. I have health issues that means I can fall over when my legs give way. I use crutches, but when I fall, my main concern is trying not to get hurt, so concern for my ear buds is far from my mind. So far, I have fallen over a number of times while using these ear buds and not once have they fallen off my ears. I would imagine they would be great for runners or for use during gym workouts for the same reason - they don't fall out.\n\nThe battery life has not caused me any concerns. I tend to use them for between 2 to 6 hours at most though. Each time I stop using them they go back in their charging case. I charge the case every few days - not because it is out of power, but just to keep it topped up.\n\nSound quality for me is perfectly fine. I tend to listen to BBC Sounds or to Audible audiobooks. I am not an audiophile - these are more than good enough for me.\n\nUsing for making phone calls - I have had no real complaints from people on the other end of a call. I have often used them to make calls from a car or when outside, even in windy weather. Although once when I was out in extremely windy and wet weather the other person did say they had trouble hearing me - which is understandable.\n\nThe control buttons, as with all such ear buds, do take a little getting used to as not all devices use the same sequence of short or long taps to do the same things. However, they do work pretty well. The basics or volume up / down and pause/play work great - I tend to do other things on the phone rather than try to remember the exact button press method for more complicated functions.\n\nThe best feature to me at least - and remember, I'm not an audiophile - is that you can wear both buds, but turn one off. This means you can double the length of time you can use the earbuds between recharging - as long as you only use one at a time. It also allows you to have one ear free to listen to your surroundings / other people. For listening to audiobooks or music while out and about this works well for me. When one goes flat (only happened once on a long day out), you simply turn the other bud on, and carry on. It means I don't need to carry the charging case with me on a day trip.\n\nI've only had them for a few weeks, so I can't comment on how long they will last - only time will tell. As long as they last more than 12 months, I'll likely replace them when they fail with the same ones, or possibly their successor.\n\nIn summary, they meet all my requirements and I'm very happy with them.",
        "I finally bought these earbuds after years of considering and I am so glad I did! I was previously put off by the short battery life of such products and also because I wanted to use them with an iPhone and have found that Apple earphones are too large to fit my relatively small ears. (I have ended up buying childrens\u2019 earphones and then putting the smallest foam tip on the ends and they still feel a bit too big). So when I saw that these came with several different sizes of ear pieces, were small in the first place and also had a good long battery life I decided to try some, and I\u2019m so pleased I did! They fit nicely into my ears and the curly part makes sure they stay in place so you don\u2019t have to force them into your ears to make them stay! I use them in the car and find I can hear the person I am speaking to far more clearly than when I was running my phone through the car\u2019s audio system, and they have a similar experience. I assume this is because of the noise cancelling function. The battery has not run out on me yet and the little charging case is really neat. Altogether I really am thrilled with these and would highly recommend them. I love the colour too!"

        "I love these headphones, amazing battery life even if you use them all day, they'll literally last me weeks to a month. Great volume, they do leak a little but that's at high volume. Great with taking calls, they're fine in the rain, comfortable for long use, ive even worn them to bed and will lay on them.1000% worth the money and as my first pair of headphones i cant believe I've gone this long without a pair.\n\nI don't really use them for the noise canceling feature, however i have used the feature and id say they work good for that. It's like sticking a conch to your ear, completely blocks out background noise like fans and does a good job muffling more concentrated sounds like talking or construction\n\nThe only thing that is negative is they are a little big, so while they have great extensions, I'd recommend a little caution if you have a small head. Also the pause and play button, while great with music and youtube, is a little finicky with streaming sites (hulu, netflix etc)",
        "I bought these, hoping for a better outcome than I have had in the past with beats. And I am pleased to say that I haven't had any headaches or discomfort from these at all! I used to get horrible headaches from my beats because they would squeeze my noggin. These are definitely more comfortable and the sound quality is great! If you have the headphones above the 50% sound there is sound leakage.\n\nMy only complaint is that the noise cancelling feature doesn't seem to make a difference FOR ME, it may be because I am deaf in my right ear. I couldn't attest to this for hearing people. I will say that when I wear these that I am able to study even with my husky having zoomies.\n\nOverall, these are an excellent, affordable option for someone who wants a good quality set of headphones but do not want to pay SONY or Beats prices.",
        "I love these headphones so much, they\u2019re great quality, the sound and bass are good for what you pay for. I love how aesthetically pleasing they are and add a little touch to your outfits. only disadvantage is, they sound leak and they smell weird when they\u2019re first unpackaged. but the smell goes away after a few wears. overall tho 8.5/10 on these headphones.",
        "So I wanted to wait and test them out for a while before I did a review. Had the headphones for over a month now and I love them! Very lightweight, the battery life is amazing, I don\u2019t always use them so I didn\u2019t have to charge them yet but the battery is at 80 I believe and that\u2019s great! The only complaints i have is the sound leakage and noise cancellation. The sound does leak a bit but I don\u2019t mind that. Noise cancellation has a weird sound but that\u2019s only when you\u2019re not listening to something, so i\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s common for noise cancellation or not. If you\u2019re not a big fan on sound leak and the weird noise then probably not for you. Other than that, great headphones for the price!",

        "I wanted a cute pair of headphones but I didn\u2019t want to spend a lot of money. The style and color of these is really nice (I ordered silver) and I like how you can twist the ear pieces. However the sound leakage is horrific it\u2019s pointless to even wear them because everyone around you can hear it too which defeats the purpose for me as I don\u2019t really like people hearing what I\u2019m listening to in public spaces. The video I posted I would say my volume was about 50% and some people may think that sound leakage is fine but it\u2019s by biggest pet peeve with headphones. I was testing how loud I could put my music before others could hear it and I\u2019d say I only got to about 25% volume on my iPhone before it was noticeable. So for me, a person who likes to listen to her music loud, this was a major no go so I am returning it and will probably just cave and get a nicer pair. I would say the quality of materials is probably comparable to the price although the plastic can look a little cheap up close but that didn\u2019t bother me because I really liked the style. Sound and bass was good, noise cancellation is pretty good I guess nothing crazy. Bluetooth connecting was a little weird as well and I worry it may be an issue in the future. Sound leakage was a major dealbreaker for me tho. Embarrassed at the thought of everyone on a plane or in a coffee shop hearing my music so loudly so I\u2019m gonna find a better pair.",

Bluetooth was easy to pair and the wired option was great to have during the flight. They were comfortable to wear for long periods. Overall good choice for affordable noise-cancelling headphones.",
        "The sound is amazing and the battery life is really long! Real easy for my 12 her old to connect to also!!",
        "Granted they are still pretty new to me, but I am a huge fan of these!!\nI had been looking for good over the ear headphones for the gym and this is the second pair I\u2019ve bought, but my favorite thus far!\nMy other pair are Phillips and are fine, but these are big, comfortable and I\u2019m so impressed with the sound quality as well as the noise cancelation they have!\nSome reviews complained about phone calls, and FaceTime calls with them but I have no complaints!\nVery happy with my purchase!!",
        "I did enjoy the headphones and the size of them. One problem is the static that is created when using your phone with them. I used them as a board op, (corded), so whenever I used my phone I had interference. I can't have that due to the position I'm in because I thought it was the broadcast until I realized what was happening. Speaking of corded - I didn't realize it came with a 3.5mm cord because one didn't come included. I use a different one (longer) that I bought separately, so I didn't need it thankfully, which is why I didn't check for one. They're nice headphones, but just didn't work for what I needed them for.",
        "I imagine these don't have the best sound quality in comparison to other, more expensive alternatives. That said, they work well for me on my walks and in the office. I love the color, it's easy to set up, and the battery has lasted for weeks without a charge. I'm tempted to buy another pair so I can keep one at work and one in my car for hikes.",
        "Great comfort and quality"

        "UPDATE-\nI had some initial difficulties connecting to my work PC but turns out it was due to drivers on my PC, contacted costumer service and they patiently and helpfully give me pointers to find the issue, always assuring me that if the headphones were indeed damage I could get them changed ASAP.\nBut no need, once drivers were fixed it connected like a charm, have them on my phone for music while working and for audio messages coming in, but whenever a zoom call comes through these bad boys switch almost seemlesly to the PC and once the call is done I go back to my music without pressing any buttons or doing anything. Sound quality of the mic is superb both with or without the boom mic but definitely clearer with the mic. Sound profile is also really good for my taste, bassy and clear, they're super lightweight and feel very sturdy, got a few compliments for them as they look sexy AF I'm my opinion. Give them a go, you'll be pleasantly surprised\n\nPrevious review:\nGood bang for your buck headphones, well built, the battery last a fair amount of time and the sound quality is really good, the passive noise cancelling due to the headphone construction is also a nice plus, especially in a crowded office. BUT I wasn't able to use the microphone at all, it just won't connect to my computer, when the driver changes to the microphone the headset goes out completely, no sound, no response, as soon as I switch to just audio it works well so it didn't work at all for what I needed it but as a normal pair of headphones it is really good",
        "These are really incredible. Excellent sound and comfort and really lightweight for a rechargeable, over-the-ear headphone.\n\nConnection to bluetooth is very simple and they stay connected. Battery life is fantastic as well.\n\nI especially LOVE that the boom mic is removeable, so if you're just listening to music you can leave it off, and if you are on a business call or video meeting you can add it on for more precise voice while muting peripheral noises. Even without the boom mic attached, the headset has a built in mic that works just fine, so you don't have to remove your earphones when answering a call.\n\nThis is the 3rd different BackBay product I've purchased, and I've found them to be extremely well designed, manufactured, and of high quality with long-lasting battery life.",
        "This is a good product although I feel the buttons are too close. You have to be careful when you are trying to turn up or down the volume and you are talking to someone you may accidentally press the button in the center and disconnect the call. The volume buttons could be a little more raised in order to avoid an accidental disconnect. I liked the fact that I could wear the headset on top of my earplugs when I was on the airplane so I could hear my movie.\nThis Bluetooth headset connected very quickly to my phone without any problems. Easy to set up. The sound is very clear when listening to music as well as holding a conversation. Overall, I feel this is a very good Bluetooth headset for the money. I would definitely recommend it to others.",
        "I've been working from home for a few years now, and I've tried a lot of different headphones over the years. Nothing has compared to the ClearCall 70 headphones at this price point.\n\nThe sound quality is excellent, both for listening to music and for taking calls. The microphone does a great job of blocking out background noise, so my callers can hear me clearly even when I'm working in a noisy environment.\n\nThe headphones are also very comfortable to wear for long periods of time. The ear cups are soft and plush, and the headband is adjustable so I can find a perfect fit.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend the ClearCall 70 headphones for anyone looking for a high-quality, comfortable, and versatile pair of headphones.",
        "I do like the sound of the headphones overall. The fit is a little off, but doable. Finish seems good.\nThe mic went out after just a couple uses.\nAmazon return period has expired. Waiting on manufacturer response. Will update if I hear back and they handle to my satisfaction.",
        "I recently had the opportunity to try out the Back Bay Clear All 70 wireless headphones, and I must say, I was quite impressed with their performance. These headphones offer a winning combination of exceptional sound quality, comfortable fit, and convenient wireless connectivity.\n\nStarting with the audio quality, the Clear All 70 headphones delivered a rich and immersive listening experience. The sound reproduction was clear, well-balanced, and detailed across different genres of music. Whether I was listening to energetic rock tracks or mellow acoustic melodies, the headphones provided a dynamic range that enhanced the overall enjoyment.\n\nThe wireless connectivity of the Clear All 70 headphones worked flawlessly. The Bluetooth connection remained stable, allowing me to move around without any interruptions or dropouts in audio. The pairing process was quick and hassle-free, and I appreciated the extended range that allowed me to stay connected to my device even when I moved away from it.",

        "I love these headphones! I have a fairly large head and they adjust to fit perfectly. They are very light and comfortable. The battery life is amazing. I usually listen an hour or two a day and only have to charge them every few weeks. I think the sound quality is good, but I am usually listening to audiobooks--so I'm not sure that is the best test for sound quality. There isn't active noise canceling, but the over-the-ear cups do a good job of blocking out outside noise. I've taken some phone calls while I'm wearing them and it's easy to hear the phone and easy for the person I'm talking to to hear me. I would recommend these headphones!",
        "The battery lasts forever, they're crazy comfortable, the bluetooth connection is super easy, they sound great (though I'm not an expert in this area), and there's no active noise cancelling! I'm one of those people who finds noise cancelling makes me feel pressure in my ears, but good luck finding bluetooth over ear headphones without that feature! The best thing about these is how comfortable they are. I'd returned a few pairs already and was considering buying one of the super expensive noise cancelling headsets (which allow you to turn the noise cancelling off) just to get something that wouldn't squish my ears and head (both of which are on the large side). But these are perfect! And affordable! I was skeptical that the battery life would be good at this price but it is truly excellent. Only thing I don't love is how long you have to long press the button to turn them on and off (a long time), but that's just something to get used to.",
        "What They Are: Lightweight, Stylish, and Comfy!\n\nWhat They\u2019re Not: Noise Cancelling\n\nThese headphones offer solid performance at an affordable price point. While they may not deliver anything extraordinary, it's unrealistic to expect that from a pair of headphones priced below a couple hundred dollars. The overall quality is decent, and the sound output is satisfactory. However, it's worth noting that external noises are only partially muffled, so complete sound isolation from your surroundings isn't achieved.\n\nOne noticeable drawback is that the sound occasionally pauses for a moment when switching between apps on your phone, which can be a bit annoying. Nevertheless, considering their price range, these headphones are on par with other options available in the $30-$50 range.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're seeking a budget-friendly pair of headphones that offer decent audio quality without breaking the bank, these headphones are a reasonable choice. Just keep in mind the minor inconvenience of sound pauses during app switching.",
        "They're comfortable and last all week with their battery life. Good value for the price and they look nice. The low end of the sound isn't super strong, so may not be the right headphone for you if you're looking for it. The app it comes with its also not very helpful and ended up not using it at all since I couldn't adjust the eq.",
        "They sound great. Battery lasts a long time. Very comfortable. Good range. I use them for work calls and everyone reports the mic quality is good. I'm kind of amazed you can get something this good for this less than $50. Replaced airpods pro and don't regret it.",
        "Quality through out",
        "for the price, these are so much better than i thought they would be! sound quality isn't the best, but it gets the job done. battery life is incredible!! used these for a 10 hour car ride and the battery only went down 15-20%! doesn't completely block out outside noise, but muffles it very well. would definitely recommend these!",
        "These are my first pair of Bluetooth headphones, and I'd say they're alright. I've been wanting to get a pair of Bluetooth headphones for awhile now and finally settled on these ones.\nAs someone who's never been too concerned with top tier sound quality these are good for the price. It did take me a few days to get used to the sound, but now they're good and the quality doesn't bother me at all. The app you can download and connect these to is alright but it doesn't offer a lot of choices.\nThese are SUPER comfy. As someone who wears glasses, I haven't had a problem with the stems digging into my head at all which is really nice. The cups go all the way over your ears and they fit near perfectly for me.\nThe battery life is really good too. They were at 74% out of the box and I've been using them constantly for a few days now, sometimes accidently leaving them on overnight, and they're only down to 62%.\nI have had an occasional problem where it glitches out occasionally but disconnecting and then reconnecting fixes that problem. There is some slight hissing occasionally but it doesnt happen often so it doesn't really annoy me. There is quite a bit of sound bleed however. If you have you're volume turned up over halfway you're gonna hear some bleed. It's not a ton, but it's enough to hear from a few feet away.",

Isolano bene dal resto dell'ambiente. La resa acustica \u00e8 ottima.

Yo mismo los he probado y puedo decir que son ligeros, c\u00f3modos y aunque no tienen cancelaci\u00f3n de ruido activa, los auriculares a\u00edslan bastante bien de forma pasiva. El sonido es correcto y puede funcionar con bater\u00eda v\u00eda bluetooth. La duraci\u00f3n de la bater\u00eda anuncia 40 horas, no lo he comprobado. Pero m\u00e1s de 20h si que aguantan.

        "They work so well, the sound quality is fantastic and once you get to know the buttons very easy to use. They are so much better that my last pair (different brand) the battery lasts a long long time and yet charges quickly, also very comfortable to wear. By far the best I have ever bought, well worth the price.",
        "Pros:\nBattery - I charge mine maybe twice in a month. 10/10\nSound quality - To me they sound like the quality you would expect for this price point. This is a non-skimping price point and it shows. 9/10\nANC - works well for me. If you're looking for headphone that block out everything without the help of audio, these are not them. 8/10\nTransparency - Also works as you should expect. 8/10\nOverall Score - 9/10",
        "My daughter told me what she wanted in one of these, and pointed out a 350 Sony units characteristics. Can't afford that, but these seemed to have what she liked in a Sony for a fraction of the price. She said they work real well. The only thing that doesn't completely live to the claims is the noise cancelling feature, she said it's pretty good, but not completely silent. But still for the price, I recommend.",

        "Lightweight - great audio and sound. Perfect pair of wrap around earphones for use during workout whether at the gym or running and jogging. Stays put and out of the way. Very comfortable to wear and great battery life to get lost in your favorite songs. Must have at a great price.",
        "I bought these after trying over the ear noise blocking headphones on an airplane ride.\nThese do such a better job of blocking out sounds and the volume is amazing. I love how each ear bud works independent of the other one, so I can just wear one if I want. Best part is since they fit in my ear instead of over my ear, they help keep my ears from hurting when the plane lands and takes off. Super easy to set up!\nLove the minimal packaging, and how the earbuds fit so snugly in the case. Price was good, too. Thanks for a quality product at a great price! Overall a great product!",
        "I ride motorcycle alot and prefer to wear earbuds to stop the wind buffeting. I hate helmets and never wore them before I moved to a state that requires them by law. Now, I wear a half helmet. Full face helmets are superior in that they stop the wind buffeting. Bring in earbuds. They stop the buffeting, play music, and make the ride way more enjoyable. I've owned a lot of earbuds I thought were superior fit and never would fall out, but eventually, they all did. I don't know if you've ever had an earbud fallout on the highway at 70-80mph, but finding said earbud, is like a needle in a haystack. Then I got these. I've had them a month so far, countless hours of riding later, I've recharged the case once, and am currently sitting at 49%. It feels like the case holds 100 recharges, it's insane! The hooks, the main reason I bought them, are soft, feel great, and have kept me from losing one of these going down the highway about 3 times now! I have really small ear canals and the smallest extra bud they provide fits very well. The audio is amazing for the price point and they get loud enough to block out the world. They're not sennheisers or beyerdynamics, but they definitely hold their own to headphones in their price range. I don't use the buttons on the earbuds since I have a phone mount on my motorcycle, so I can't speak to their usage. Overall, I am actually very satisfied with these headphones! I have already recommended them to a few riders and will keep recommending them",
        "I've gone through a bunch of wireless earbuds, and let me tell you, my last ones were a disaster. They kept doing swan dives into the dishwasher \u2013 not cool. I had to get creative and tie a string to them so they wouldn't take a watery plunge every time they slipped out.\n\nBut hey, I finally got my hands on this pair, and they're a game-changer. They've got these hooks that snugly sit over my ears, comfy as heck, and the battery life? Unreal! Sound quality and volume? Top-notch. Seriously, I should've snagged these before dealing with all those lousy ones!",
        "I recently got my hands on the Wireless Earbud with 75Hrs Playtime, and it's safe to say these earbuds are a game-changer, especially for those with an active lifestyle. Designed with flexible ear hooks, these earbuds stay put during the most intense workouts. No worries about them falling out. The three sizes of ear tips add a personal touch to the comfort factor. And with an IP7 waterproof rating, they're ready to take on sweat, rain, or whatever else you throw at them during your workouts. Whether you're hitting the gym or just chilling, these earbuds deliver a premium audio experience that elevates your every move. Highly recommended for those who demand the best from their tech.",
        "I like this style of headphone because the have the physical button to press to pause/play. Many headphones of this type don\u2019t have this feature. They also have physical buttons for volume control, so you aren\u2019t tapping at your ears over and over trying to turn down the volume. The battery life is great and the sound quality is solid. The case could be a tiny bit easier to open, but that is a pretty tiny drawback.",
        "Amazing wireless headphones! Great quality sound with a bottomless battery. They also charge very quickly so you are never missing out.

        "In my opinion these earbuds are very good. The sound quality is impressive, the drivers are 14mm so bigger than most other buds. This larger size gives you a deeper bass and a bigger frequency response. They have a built in noise cancelling microphone for calls and have next/previous track, pause/play, volume up/down and power on/off physical control buttons on the buds, which are easy to use and easy to get to whilst wearing them.\nThe over ear hooks are very secure and don't fall out when out running.\nThe buds themselves are a little bigger than others I have owned, but the size doesn't cause me any issues, even if worn whilst lying down in bed for example.\nCharging is easy with the included USB c cable, and the case charges the buds whilst they are inside. It also has a charge % indicator so you know when the battery needs charging.\nOverall they seem good value for money and I would recommend.",

        "Bought these for about $14 US back in July 2022 and have been using them for casual music listening, video games, and watching videos. No complaints so far!\n\nThe ear cups are large enough such that they fit over your ears (instead of the horribly uncomfortable on-ear headphones) and I'm able to wear them for >2 hours without getting sore ears. They don't fold, however the headband is extendable. Regarding sound quality, it's passable; they sound a bit muffled compared to some other headphones I own (however I'm no audiophile). Also these headphones are quite durable, as I've accidently dropped them off the side of my desk several times without any noticeable structural or cosmetic damage.\n\nThey've been my go-to headphones in most cases. I'd say they're quite good value for most people, and makes sense for casual use at home.",
        "These are the best budget headphones I've ever used. Better than expected sound quality and bass and they don't get uncomfortable when worn for extended periods. I bought these cause I wanted something cheap but kinda decent after losing my Sony headphones. These aren't my sonys, but for $10 I'd definitely recommend these if you're on a budget.",
        "For the price these are much better than I expected. Yes, they are made of relatively inexpensive materials, however I get really good sound from them. I only just started using them so I am unable to speak to their durability. They do fit my ears comfortably even after semi-prolonged usage. The longest I've worn them was about three plus hours. Other earphones I've had actually hurt, these my only substantive complaint is I got sweaty behind my ears, but that is not unexpected.",
        "I got these cause I needed something affordable and a good brand to have with me for podcast recording and they do the job! The only thing I will say is that I don't see these lasting very long, the material and quality are super cheap. I feel like I am going to rip off the headphone wire and the headphones themselves are super light and flimsy. Overall, these are for temporary usage and I don't expect them to last that long. Wish they were better quality.",
        "Nothing extremely fancy but nonetheless a great product. I use them for producing at home.",
        "After 2.5 years, I decided to write a review for these headphones. I have a much better pair of closed-back headphones that sound much better. Compared to my more expensive Tascam headphones these sound just average. Thing is, these headphones weigh next to nothing and they are comfortable. I've been using them for more than 2 years, so the quality is good enough. I wear them off and on all day long.\n\nThe weight and the comfort are the reason I wear them. I think of them as being a good value.",
        "These are well constructed comfortable headphones as they fit over the ear. They are sensitive and easily driven to loud volume. HOWEVER, the sound quality is wooden and muffled with no treble. Human voices are not distinct and music lifeless. Tried on several different devices, but they are not suitable for any use. Returned.",

S\u00ed tienen bajo pero no retumba como aud\u00edfonos m\u00e1s costosos.

Si buscas algo para escuchar m\u00fasica y que retumbe el bass creo que no son la mejor opci\u00f3n, ser\u00eda mejor comprar algo m\u00e1s encaminado a eso, con m\u00e1s bass y que est\u00e9n m\u00e1s robustos.

        "I don't write many reviews on here and I came straight here once I got these going.\n\nFirst, I switched to the big ear cushions from stock as it pressed the ear buds to my ears to make a better seal. and wow.. THE BASS!\n\nI have a Samsung phone and to me the equalizer is not so good In my opinion. So I purchased an equalizer from the Play store to have more fine tuning and this unlocked the full potential of these earbuds. (If you decide to, find an equalizer with loudness, brightness, clarity and gain control)\n\nThese sound and feel better then some of the $100 Sony buds I've had in the past.\n\nI'd say the more expensive earbuds are better plug and play than these when it comes to sound quality. But with having the right equalizer. These blow the expensive brands out of the water! Which makes this an excellent buy for the price!\n\nAll I have is nice things to say about these ear buds.\n\nSnug fit, low profile, fast pairing, very light, great bass and tone, no propitiatory app, great build quality and nice case.\n\nI hope you enjoy these as much as I do!",
        "I did not expect this to be as good as I found it to be. They come in a charging case, and it includes different sized ear buds for a custom fit. They came half charged and I used them right away. Easy to pair with Bluetooth on my phone. Clear sound. High quality, snug but comfortable fit for running. So far, so good!",
        "Admittedly I tried to get these wireless earbuds on my ear and couldn\u2019t. Yes I am a dufus! So I asked my generation Z son and he said figure it out yourself \ud83e\udd23 So I left them on the table and wouldn\u2019t you know the following morning, the smartest person in the house, my wife, had them on her ears and showed me how to put them on. Easy! Pairing was easy. Charging is easy. Sound is great. After years of the economical $20 wired Apple EarPods always dying within 6 months and then upgrading to the more expensive wireless $160 wireless Airpods only to see two fail within a year\u2026 I was at wits end. I hike a lot and need the music and podcasts so out of desperation I took one my kid\u2019s older beats headphones which made me look like an old man! Alas, I scrolled Amazon and found these wireless earbuds\u2026 price seemed too good to be true but the reviews were really good. I decided to give them a try and after several days of use\u2026 decided to keep them. So far so good, and the sound is better then I expected. Two thumbs up.",

        "The buds arrived on time and nearly 100% charged. I love that they came 4 sizes of ear tips as well as a charging cable.

These babies fit perfectly while I'm working out. Highly sweat resistant and hold their position under high movement. Due to the size of the ear cuff, I would only recommend these for adults as I tried them on my 8 year old and they did fit as comfortably on her.\n\nOver all these are a very good quality bud for the cost, and I would highly recommend them for anyone with an active or athletic lifestyle as well as those whonsimply want a comfortable ear piece to enjoy some music or a hands free call.

        "These are the best ear buds ever! I waited a couple months to write review because I wanted to really put these buds to the test. These are my go to ear buds. I like them better than my Gallaxy buds! They are so comfortable and the battery life is amazing. I use theough entire workday without needing to charge. You can still hear everything going on around you, so these buds are amazing for work, if you need to be able to respond to others or the phone. Also, they won't fall off, even when running, bending, etc. Not for use in a super noisy area as they do not block hearing ambient sounds; however, the microphone does block background noise in calls. I am so happy that I purchased these buds! I use them daily.",
        "I have gone through numerous earbuds over the years. Inevitably, they all lose sound out of one or the other. That could be because in getting tangled around me, I may pull the wiring from one bud loose eventually. Serious problem for me, as I am always listening to an audiobook. I\u2019ve been wanting to get wireless, but I have always been afraid that they would fall out of my ears. I already have enough trouble with the earbud causing pain after a short period of time. I have small ear, canals, and the earbud, even with the smallest attachment, can be problematic.\n\nBecause I usually only have listened with one in, because I like to be aware of what\u2019s going on around me, I had looked into the open air version. Almost all of them seem to hook over the outer ear, in a way that would completely interfere with my glasses.\n\nI didn\u2019t know what to expect from these. They look very strange, but I thought I\u2019d give them a try. I am so very glad I did! They hook onto the ear very lightly but securely. I know they\u2019re there, but they\u2019re not heavy, and they don\u2019t bother me . There\u2019s nothing to go into the ear canal, so that is no longer a problem, no more pain. With the open ear, I can have both in, and still be able to hear what\u2019s going on around me, which is a huge plus for me. The volume has been excellent. The only time that\u2019s been a problem is when I\u2019m on a very loud bus, with too much motor noise around me. That\u2019s happened once out of all the times I\u2019ve worn them.\n\nThe battery life seems excellent. Once they\u2019re in the case, they no longer connect to the phone, so they are no longer connected to the Bluetooth for the playback. I need to make sure that I turn off play, before I take them out and pop them on, if I don\u2019t wanna miss a word, lol. They do automatically connect as soon as they come out of the case. Once they\u2019re in the case, they are also charging. You do need to be aware of the case having enough charge on it, and recharging that, because it can\u2019t charge the earbuds if it\u2019s not charged , lol. The controls seem fairly easy, but I have issues with dexterity and sensation in my fingers, so I still have to poke around to find the on-off, but that\u2019s my own problem and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll learn it eventually.\n\nThe only possible problem with these, if you are so, inclined, would be using them for phone calls. It\u2019s been spotty, some people don\u2019t complain, or simply say that it sounds like I\u2019m in a tunnel. Others have said they can\u2019t understand anything. That may be because they are the open air conduction rather than the bone conducting. I was not comfortable with the ones that do the bone conduction for the sound, and I don\u2019t make enough phone calls that I need these for, overall. I\u2019ve had some long conversations with people who have not had any trouble dealing with any \u201cdistortion\u201c in how well, my voice transmits.\n\nExtremely happy with this purchase!",
        "I hesitated with purchasing these because of the reviews saying that the sound quality was poor. The sound is fine. All you have to do is slide them down your ear and the sound will get higher. If the earpiece is up high on your ear, the sound is lower. The sound is not as good as my Samsung ear buds but they get the job done and saves my ears from hurting. I use earpieces to listen to audiobooks most of the time but I've received calls as well and haven't had any trouble hearing the caller. They fit my girly ears just fine and the battery life is OUTSTANDING. They last all day and I rarely put them back into the charging case until bedtime. I would definitely recommend these. They are comfortable and cool looking.",
        "The good.\nSound quality is good, the fit is great, battery life is average about 4 hours.\nThe bad\nWould connect randomly when not in use, would independently play different sounds.\nOne headphone would die and hour before the other.\n\nOverall I would give these a 3. The ok ok for the price if you use the coupon, but need work",
        "Maintain situational awareness, I use them in my classroom and when in the hospital. Makes it easy to still monitor my students as you can still easily hear them and easy to maintain awareness of what is going on especially in a hospital room so you are not surprised when a nurse or doctor walked in. I find them very comfortable (the design is great for those of us who where glasses as they do not loop over the ear) and good sound quality for what they are. Do not expect the high quality of a set of Shure earbuds, but the quality is good for what the are and the price you are paying for them. Remember to compare apples to apples (headphones of the same type and price range) there is no comparison to a pair of Shure Aonics but they are not in the same class, price range, or even type. But then again that is a comparison of apples to alligators. For what they are I love them, and use them frequently. Also they are comfortable and can be used individually, they also fit in the \u201cwrong\u201d ear comfortably. I prefer to have them only one in my right ear while I am teaching to keep in contact with colleagues.",
        "I don't know this brand and its product, but based on previous reviews and product info I know, I gave a try and immediately notice the difference compared with other air earbuds. The main advantage is its unique egernomic design that won't put on weight on the ear top where usually that's prone to accumulate dirts, oils, and sweats. Secondly, it holds prety steadily but not pinchy so you won't feel it at all long time. I purchased this for my mom so she can wear at home all day enjoying the musics but never worry about missing phone calls or door bells. Third, the batteries of both earbuds and its host can last a few days without charging. I think as long as we are not really getting into the doomsday, battery is the least what you should concern. Bottom line, it does exactly what it's advertised, lgiht weight, no nonsense, easy to control, clear audio quality, free shipping and return, what more do I expect from 20$?! I don't understand why people complain its bass quality and noise isolation. It's like complaining Tesla can't take gasoline."

        "The value for money was worth it. It\u2019s durable, kid and adult friendly and most importantly not too loud so I won\u2019t worry about damaging my child\u2019s hearing.

        "They\u2019re as easy to use as any other set of headphones at this price point. They\u2019ve lasted a year with our 4-year-old and they still work, so that\u2019s something. I put them on once and realized the sound quality is garbage. My kid doesn\u2019t know the difference. Ambivalent.",
        "My granddaughter has had 3 pair of these. Her first set was used by her for 2+ School years and we just had to replace them. The ones she uses at home are the oldest and used most frequently and they are still going strong! I recommend these headphones!",
        "Amazing product for toddlers. Easy to connect to any bluetooth device. The volume is great for kids because even at max volume they are no where near as loud as standard headphones. My daughter loves to just wear these around the house even when they are not connected to anything. Great product for parents tired of hearing let it go..let it go haha",

        "These are the second pair I have purchased. First was a couple years ago for my oldest kid, who loves them, so I just go a pair for my youngest. They really are great headphones. The kids love them, super easy for them to use, turn on off and charge. The bluetooth connects flawlessly every time to their iPads. They find the very comfortable to wear, I dont have to ask them to put them on so I can hear their terrible shows. The pair from 2 years ago still work great and have great battery life still as well. Also for road trips super important to have. If the battery does go dead you can always plug the supplied Aux cable directly into the ipad and headphones and they work.\n\nIf you have any issues or questions their support is amazing as well. I originally was having charging issues but it turned out to be faulty cord I had laying around, not their product.\n\nHighly recommend this product.",

        "Great sound quality, easy to use , has a long distance range and perfect for the elderly.",
        "Easy to connect. Good sound. Mute button would have been handy to turn off the commercials.\nWhen they come on I take off the headset and give my ears a rest. So that my ears don't hurt I extend both sides, that works. No lip sync. My first charge was only 4hrs? Every subsequent charge has been on average 4-4 1/2hrs. I do not get 15-20 hours of use as advertised. I only get 10-11 hours max. That and no mute button is why I gave them 4 stars. The handbook does not tell you how to change the batteries but I figured it out if needed in the future and you cannot contact the manufacturer in China! Here's hoping they last at $80 as it seems that so many of these headphones either break or do not last that long.",
        "Installation not easy if you are not familiar with this kind of tech device.",
        "The good news - it works and sounds good once all connected properly. The bad news - the directions are confusing. The TV sound has to manually be changed from normal sound to optical sound; I had a Cowin before and it did it automatically. The red transmitter power light only comes on when I switch the TV sound source (they do sort of tell you this). I don't like having to retract the headband every time I need to recharge the headphones. \"connect the equipment to a different circuit than the TV\"; electricity is electricity this makes no sense and the unit still worked when connected to the same circuit. It took over an hour to figure everything out. It should be a 5 minute job. A longer (6 foot) optical cable would have been useful.",

        "First off, it's important to note that these headphones fill a niche: somebody who wants an over-ear style closed-back headset that has some degree of water/dust resistance (in this case, IP55). They probably shouldn't be the only pair of headphones you own and use. These are ideal for exercise (since they can handle sweat) or anywhere they might get hit with drops of rain or sand. You can even use them in the bathtub without worry of splashing on them (unlike most other over-ear sets), but be very careful not to submerge or drop them in the water.\n\nIf you don't need the water resistance, you can find better audio quality and comfort. For home listening, I'd suggest springing a bit more for a comfortable open-back headset set, and for casual listening outside the house, high quality earbuds (which I'd also suggest springing a bit more for) are still ideal. However, my problem with earbuds is that when exercising, my ear canals tend to tighten up and they become extremely uncomfortable. This set is built to stay on your head while exercising, so it can feel a bit tight after a couple hours, but the earpads have a soft \"cooling gel\" that is better than other sets I've used, and it definitely gets more comfortable after a short break-in period. As an added bonus, the pads are removable and the outer lining is washable (although they feel pretty durable, I'm curious to see how long they last). The headband has a strip of rubber to soften the pressure, but it does feel a bit too hard and some comfort improvements could be made there. On the other hand, it feels built like a tank - they're light on your head, but still feel extremely durable. Other bonuses include a standard audio jack as an option instead of Bluetooth, big sturdy volume control buttons that aren't a pain to use like most headset controls, and an insane battery that lasts ages (I got at least the manufacturer spec of 35 hours, using them 2-3 hours a day for nearly two weeks without needing to recharge).\n\nThese weren't the first pair of water-resistant cans I bought from Phillips. The previous version was the SH402, which I bought based on goodwill coming from their excellent X2 headphones I've used for years. These were an absolute travesty, with buzzing out of one side and audio quality that sounded like somebody playing music under a couch in the next room with the door closed, and I'd never returned something so fast. The A4216 set VASTLY improves on these, with very good audio quality. It's still not top-tier in the pure audio department or anything - it's a bit overly bassy with a hint of a muffled quality in the way a lot of closed-back headsets that are built to prevent audio leakage are - but it's more than good enough as a minor compromise to balance out the other benefits this set has (especially for the reasonable price), and again, if you don't need an exercise/water-resistant headset, you'd probably want to look elsewhere anyway. If you happen to be in that particular market though, I'm not sure you can really do much better than these.",
        "I want to start by saying that the audio quality on these is exactly what you'd expect from headphones under $100. The lows are a little muddled and the bass is lacking, but other than that they have generally decent audio quality. I'm able to listen to all of my favorite songs without feeling like anything is seriously lacking, but I definitely won't use these for any studio work.\n\nThat said: holy crap I don't think these are capable of running out of battery. I've been using them at the gym 5 days a week for about an 1.5 hours and they just... don't die? They advertise 30 hour battery life but I'm at about 2 months of continuous use and I JUST plugged them in for the first time. Not even because they died, but because I had the reasonable human impulse to plug them in after 2 months of not doing so. I'm not sure if these headphones have the capability to harness power from the sun or from God herself or what.\n\nI would normally give headphone like these about a 3 or so out of 5, but the battery life alone adds another star. Not to mention the price being so low... These headphones are honestly great. I still prefer my AT ATH-M50xBTGM wireless headphones when I'm at home because the quality is superior (they were also $200, to be fair) but this particular pair of philips headphones comes with me everywhere I go simply for the sheer utility of them. It's almost a 100% guarantee that they will have enough charge for whatever I'm doing that day.\n\nBased on the price point, battery life and overall quality, these get a 4.5 from me. Rounding to a 5 because Amazon.",
        "I have had these for about a week. I was looking for a headset I could use for home office with audio, but could also be used for walks outdoors. I ordered one prior to this and they made my ears sweat, and were not so comfortable due to how large and plasticy feel the ear cushion was despite it's decent reviews, but they KEPT disconnecting from my lap top off and on mid calls, which was a FAIL... so I returned them and then ordered these.\nPROS:\nThey are very sturdy, don't feel cheap at all.\nThe sound quality (my oppinion) is GREAT - deep base, but sound is clear, and decent, loud enough.\nFit snug I suppose if you will workout, run, they should stay put.\nThe ear peice is like a soft mesh which I like better than some fake leather/rubber type ones that make your ear sweat.\nThey have NOT disconnected ONCE from my laptop and I use them all day.\nCons:\nThey are a bit tight, which is good I guess if you will run/jog...but I think moving forward I will get ON ear vs over the ear, because they put pressure (not ALOT) enough where I just don't LOVE it.\nWhile the sound QUALITY is very good, they don't get very loud, but it's like the perfect amount, not too loud not too soft I suppose. I HAVE Not hooked them to my phone yet so they might be different there.\nThere is a little rubber peice that covers the charge hole, my last set just had a slot, I am quite sure this will break off eventually.\nI have not tried to see if I can connect to 2 things - phone and computer, like go between the 2.\nI think won't I really don't like is the HEAD cusion - quite frankly it sucks. It is not even a cushion, more of a semi soft extra layer of rubber. My last set (Sol Republic) were SOOOOO soft at the top like a pillow of cussion and the PERFECT ear fit, not too much not too little and super soft I barely noticed them HOWEVER they were not a tight fit and would move sometimes when running - why didn't I get their latest model? they were like $160 but I probably will next time. It last me like 4 years! LOL :)\n- and final con, is lately people are like what? I cannot really hear you - but the volume is on full volume..that doesn't happen each call..so we shall see.\nIF you just want for SALES or home office, maybe a headset for that is better suited. BUT I wanted to be able to use it for that AND outdoors, so I opted for this. :)\nHope that helps.",

        "Good quality for a even better price! There\u2019s plenty reasons why these headphones are still on everyone list for \u201cmost bang for your buck\u201d. These and their little brother,the Soundcore Q20+, are some of the best value in headphones. Between durability,sound quality, ANC,fit and portability they are a solid buy everytime and a good introduction to entry level ANC headphones. Battery life incredible too",
        "I love these headphones, they last a super long time, come with a nice travel bag, and cover the ears without sitting on them. Noise cancelling is so good it annoys my boyfriend because I can\u2019t hear him when he tries talks to me \ud83d\ude02 I kind of wish they folded up nicer (they\u2019re still a little bulky if trying to pack them in a bag) but overall really nice headphones and the price is amazing for the quality.",
        "These are pretty decent headphones for the price ($35). Comfortable too. Noise Cancelling is OK. I don\u2019t know much about NC, but the best way to describe it is you can still hear a loud door knock, just not the echoes following it. Highly recommend if you only use Bluetooth mode. AUX mode is where its weakness lies. Particularly AUX with NC turned on.\n\nAUX wired mode is noticeably lower quality than Bluetooth wireless mode, but still ok quality for watching movies (though sub-average for music). HOWEVER, the biggest con which ultimately made me return these is when turning on noise cancelling while in AUX mode (necessary on planes) \u2014 there is a continuous static noise that accompanies whatever your watching/listening to unless you drown it out with high volume. However, even when drowned out, I feel the static noise still makes my ears/head ache after prolonged use. Since I got these mainly for using on the plane (AUX+NC MODE) and they do not work well in that mode, I will be returning them. Such a shame. Almost perfect for my needs.",
        "i could rave about these for HOURS - i love these so much i bought a pair for me & my eldest daughter (19)\n\nnoise cancellation - the nosie cancellation is perfect, you can tell the distinct difference between it being on & off, & even when off the sound is still sealed off to fit your ear & give you the best sound experience.\n\nganingn & streaming - this headset is so well my daughter replaced her razer pink kitty headset with these for better gaming audio, better streaming audio, & for better music - perfect for streamers !\n\nbattery life - you could leave these on for a few hours using them or not, & they would still be full battery. we forget to charge them all the time whether we\u2019re using them constantly or if we just put them off to the side for a few days to even a few weeks, they manage to hold an AMAZING charge. i don\u2019t think i\u2019ve ever had them actually die on me, most it\u2019s gone to is medium battery !! theyere battery preserving !\n\nmusic - gives out the best bass, no need to have them to loud in case it give you a headache, but is perfect for mellow music, loud music, & asmr. feels very immersive, & even does the effect of being able to only hear out of one headset & the other - super cool !\n\ngaming - can hear smaller detailings (ex: knocking in a horror game) & really sucks you into the game truly, feels like it has its own surround sound\n\ncomfort - if your sensitive to things squishing your head or easily prone to headaches, i would recommend only wearing these for shorter periods of times. my daughter wears it on her long walks (typically 1-4 hours a day) & comes back with headaches from having them on to long. as well as fitted glasses, be weary because they will squish your glasses in your head a bit, & cause headaches. besides that, they\u2019re very comfortable on the ears with the padding, & the band tracts & retracts to fit your head shape & comfort !\n\nlook - sleek & beautiful, fits a good aesthetic if you want an alternative to the expensive sony or gaming headphones. would look cute with add on cat ears or others accessories as such, or stickers ! even blank they look very aesthetically pleasing\n\noverall, these headphones i love, & my daughter can attest that she never leaves the house without them, & her person.\n\nperfect for anyone who wants to concentrate, listen to music in a tasteful way, read, game, write, & feel concentrated & immersed into it, perfect for trips or walks - the possibilities are endless !!",
        "Bought these for the gym as I wanted over the ear headphones but didn\u2019t want to break the bank on some that are going to get sweaty all the time. Sound quality is a crisp 7.5/10 and the bass is pretty decent, a cool feature is that you are able to turn on/off the noise canceling option with a physical button on the headphones, cushioning on it feels great and is easily cleanable with disinfecting wipes or such. Battery life is great on them as well I go 3 days with one charge typically 2-2 1/2 hrs a day. I also did try them for gaming when I first got them and they were great in game, I was able to hear footsteps all around with no problems you can use the Bluetooth option but there is a wire included which I suggest you use, the mic also sound pretty decent at my score of an 7/10 but for the price I think these are definitely worth it as I\u2019ve bought myself another pair as backup and also have gotten some for my niece and she loves them.",
        "Fantastic sound and airplane and ambient noise canceling. Charge lasts very long time. Refurbished version now ships with more common USB micro charging socket, not USB mini socket. Easy control system.",
        "For the amount of money it cost this product is amazing. Sound quality and comfort are are above my expectations!! I will buy again as a gift",
        "First use was in a Southwest airplane, very noticeable when I put them on, when I lifted them off during the flight I couldn't believe how loud the noise became.",
        "I bought these for use as part of an assisted listening system at our church. The room is fairly live, and the HVAC system is quite loud, so lots of reverb and white noise most of the time. The quality of construction on these is actually quite impressive for the price. The headphones are very comfortable for the 2 or so hours they are used each week, and the controls are easy to use. The sound quality is actually very good (especially for our intended use). As a musician and sound tech, I value clarity and a balanced frequency response, and these perform very well.\n\nWhat surprised me the most was the quality of the Active Noise Cancellation (ANC). They compare really well with my Bose Q35's, which are about 5x the price. The white noise of the HVAC and bad reverb of our room are completely cancelled out, which I didn't expect to happen with a sub-$100 headphone.\n\nIf you are a snobby audiophile who demands the most accurate sound possible, you are likely going to spend 10x as much on headphones that can only give marginally better performance than these do. If you are someone who wants to enjoy good quality sound with excellent ANC at a really good price, I highly recommend these headphones.",
        "I got these so I could watch programmes on my laptop without disturbing other family members, and they have become one of my favourite possessions very quickly! They are incredible. They block the sound to others, and at the same time your own sound is rich and immersive. The charge lasts a very long time too so you don\u2019t have to worry about it on long trips.\nI love them! Good value too for such a quality product.",

        "Wow!! Just received today. Don't know where to start. These are truly fantastic in every regard! I listen to all kinds of music and have owned expensive stereo systems in my car and home. This review concerns using the HA-RX500's listening to music through my PC. I am very particular about quality. I want to hear all the details in a piece of recorded music and want background parts at the right sound level in relation to the other instruments/vocals in a song. These headphones have AMAZING sound--not for $20--just amazing sound in their own right. I read a review that said they have better sound quality than a $120 pair of headphones, and I couldn't agree more. Sound is rich and full. Can hear all layers of all types of music. Bass is very impressive as are the highs, but what truly impressed me, and which I have found lacking in two other sets of headphones I recently ordered, is the quality of the mid-range sounds.\n\nThe headphones are incredibly light-feeling on your head and the ear pads are soft and very, very comfortable. The long cord is absolutely no problem and looks and feels substantive, unlike some other cheap, very thin cords. They are excellent at outside sound dampening. I researched so many headphones for hours and bought a pair of JVC HAV-570 \"Super Bass\" headphones. Admittedly, they were only $13, but they had many of the same specs as the X500's, i.e., 40mm drivers, etc, but the sound on the X500'S is literally five times better, and this saying a lot, because I was mildly satisfied with the cheaper pair (which got four stars overall on Amazon). However, wanting more, I purchased a pair of Audio-Technica ATH-M30 Professional Headphones through Amazon for $40. They lacked range and were tight and felt smothering when worn. They don't come close to the JVC X500 in sound quality. I returned them and was going to settle for the other JVC's until I saw these on Amazon).\n\nI am not an expert at describing what makes for high sound quality but I know that when someone says, when describing headphones, that they hear parts of songs they couldn't previously hear well with other headphones, that means something, if accurate. That description is absolutely true with these headphones. It's not so much you will hear sounds that you never heard at all, it is that you will hear instrumental parts and vocals (such as some back up vocals), much clearer and stronger than you hear them with other headphones. I must re-emphasize that the sound from these headphones is incredibly rich and full, especially if your system has a graphic equalizer that you can admust to your particular likes. You cannot go wrong with these headphones!! I am almost in disbelief that they cost only $18, seem solidly made, are extremely comfortable and the sound will impress you to no end. They are heaven!",
        "I run a podcast and I was searching for an affordable solution that provided three key factors: Comfort, Clarity, and Compactness. The comfort factor was the most important because if you are going to have a few of your guests wearing these for an hour, they need to feel like nothing is there. Clarity for the quality of the sound and to make sure your guests hear themselves clearly. Compactness for a podcast that has to go to multiple places.\n\nI tested these JVC HARX500 against the following: JVC HARX330, Monoprice Premium Hi-Fi Dj Style,\nVogek On Ear Headphones with Mic, Tascam TH-02, Koss UR20, and Panasonic RP-HT161-K.\n\nHere is how they stacked up:\nJVC HARX330: decent clarity and lower profile for over the ear headphones but they really hurt my ears because they didn't completely cover my ears\nMonoprice Premium Hi-Fi Dj Style: If this purchase was for just listening to music or doing something other than my needs, this would have been my choice. The set was comfortable, albeit a bit on the heavy side and the clarity was unsurpassed. By far the best of all. However, these headphones had a good seal around my ears and I was unable to hear ambient noise. As a podcaster, I need to be aware of A/C units running in the background and I was unable to hear mine when wearing this. For my purposes, I need to be able to hear things that the microphone may or may not pick up.\nVogek On Ear Headphones with Mic: I tried these just to see if on-ear headphones would work. Not for the comfort factor. However, these won the compact prize. They could fold up to the size of my palm which was a bonus.\nTascam TH-02: with all the great reviews, I thought this was going to be a winner. However, it was very bulky and didn't fit on my head properly. Good quality sound but still not great. So it didn't win the prize for comfort because of its weight. These however did fold so they could have gotten a bonus point for compactness.\nKoss UR20: These things were a beast. This means it didn't pass the compact test. However, the sound clarity was terrible. I was amazed at how distorted voices were. It sounded like every time I talked I could hear myself clipping and I didn't hear that with any other headphone.\nPanasonic RP-HT161-K: Decent slimmer profile but didn't pass the comfort test.\n\nThe JVC HARX500 met 2 of the 3 conditions I felt were the most important, comfort and clarity. After putting on these headphones, I just felt like I could easily have them on for hours without any worry of fatigue or my ears hurting. The sound coming from the speakers was true to self and was great for the price point. As mentioned above, it still allows some ambient noise to penetrate so you can hear background noise and isn't completely noise isolation which I needed. These fail the compact use case but they are still slimmer in profile compared to the Monoprice and Koss ones. I can overlook that for the top 2 needs",

        "I am using this headset every day last 6 months . No issues sound quality and noice cansellation is really good..most amazing thing is it\u2019s battery life I charge it only once in a week or once in 10 days\u2026. And the hard shell case also is with a good quality metrical\u2026 it really worth the price. Compete with all premium headphones.",
        "I bought these as a replacement for an Mpow bluetooth headset from a few years ago. These are great for the price, though the ear pads are a little small. The plastic arms look a little fragile and I can see them cracking easily if you're not careful.\n\nBattery life is really good. After a week of use they are still at full charge.\n\nThe mic sounds odd on phone calls and has a lot of echo. I'm not sure yet how to fix it.\n\nThe sound quality is ok, but the bass level is a little too high compared to all the other sets I've owned.\n\nOverall these are good for the price, but I'd rather buy the Mpow again (if they were available).",
        "Dislike Notting love it",
        "Very comfortable and battery lasts forever. I use the app to switch back and forth between my phone and my computer audio- can have two Bluetooth channels connected at a time. These work great!",
        "Awesome headphones!\nI bought these as a secondary pair of headphones I can wear around the house. The build is lightweight due to the plastic, but the sound is great for the price! Best aspect is the battery life. I've had these for about a month and a half, and I charged these a total of 3 times. I use these headphones for at least 2-3 hours daily.\nJust wanted to let you know, these are NOT noise canceling headphones. Noise canceling is not a designated feature unfortunately! But rather, it is how the headphones fit over your ears, which will naturally cancel out some noise.\nOverall, these are an easy 5/5.",
        "I ordered this mostly for the headphones, but it\u2019s worth mentioning that I received a case that doesn\u2019t even fit the headphones in it. So am I gonna return the whole item just because of the case? No, of course not, I need to replace my Raycons. (Which are really bad btw, don\u2019t buy Raycon.)\n\nAnyway, the headphones are great for what I need. Noise cancelling isn\u2019t really present, but I often need to know when people are trying to get my attention at work. Audio quality is significantly better on these than the pair they\u2019re replacing, and they\u2019re half the price. Pairing is easy and the voice isn\u2019t obnoxious. Battery life seems incredible. Went from charging my old pair nightly; I\u2019ve had this pair for four days and they\u2019re only at 70%.\n\nGo buy a listing with no case so you don\u2019t get swindled, these are pretty good",
        "I\u2019ve had these for over a month and have only charged them once! I use them at least 5x a week too at the gym. They\u2019re on the smaller size as compared to some bulky headphones. I love them.",
        "They are great quality, my last pair lasted 3.5 years but I used them every day and worked out in them 5 times a week. I just bought a new pair and they\u2019re still great, highly recommended",
        "Me lleg\u00f3 un modelo diferente al que hab\u00eda pedido y no caben en la funda r\u00edgida que mandaron, la cual tampoco coincide con la de la descripci\u00f3n...\nMal\u00edsima calidad en el servicio en resumen",

        "I've only had these a month and don't use them consistently but am impressed with the comfort - secure but not squeexing my head. And the sound is mellow with soft jazz - haven't tried them on Rock (& probably never will!) but they do have a good balance. Again, with not using them regularly, I can't speak to battery life real well, but just having them lay around & using them occasionally, the battery held up real well, and the charge time doesn't seem to be too long. Noise is not completely blocked out but, for me, that's OK - I can still be aware of what's around me, just well muffled. I would definitely recommend them.",
        "So far so good but I\u2019ve only had them a day. I\u2019m wearing them now listening to soft classical at a moderate level - this is important. I have the \u201cnoise canceling\u201d feature turned on and I can still hear the news from my iPad sitting a few feet away. If it were true noise canceling, I shouldn\u2019t be able to hear a baby screaming in my arms.\nNot truly noise canceling but it does cut out a lot of background clutter if you\u2019re truly trying to focus or tune something out.\n\nThe sound is good, they were easy to charge though it did take longer than I would have wanted. They fit my head well and cover my ears completely.",
        "I have had a pair for a couple months, and they had the most desirable qualities among affordable Bluetooth headsets. I had just ordered a second pair for work, and before it arrived I accidentally discovered that these headphones actually have multipoint capabilities. That is, I have them connected to both my work laptop for zoom calls and my phone for music at the same time. There's no switching between devices. When you start paying sounds on one, it overrides the other and vice versa. I have excessively large ears and head, and this headset fits my ears and doesn't press on my temples. The sound quality is great in my opinion, but I'm also not an audiophile. The noise cancellation isn't perfect, but it's great for the price point. The only real downside is that the mic didn't swing out, and the mic quality is not great. Other people can hear me, but it sounds like I'm on speakerphone.",
        "Pretty high quality. Bass is great. I wish they got a little louder, but that\u2019s probably a safety feature so you don\u2019t damage your hearing",
        "I am just an average user and don't expect much for a pair of headphones at this price point, but I was happy with them after I first got them. The sound at the lowest volume setting is louder than I like but I can live with it. Noise cancelling works pretty well for the price. Battery life served my needs, and didn't notice any change in battery power over time. I have a small head, and the headband is a little bit long for me.\n\nThe plastic bracket for the left earpiece broke off after less than 1 year of heavy but careful use. I suppose this is expected for headphones of this design, but I wish they weren't as disposable as the ones I grew up with. I added on a warranty just so I could get a refund without a lot of hassle. It is unfortunate that it broke structurally, because otherwise I would have been content to keep using them.",
        "It works great. Easy pairing and connection. The quality of the sound is great too. But it doesn't have an excellent noise canceling.",
        "I like these headphones a lot. They're very cute, comfortable, and have decent sound quality for the price. I don't think they noise cancel more than other headphones but are definitely a huge step up from earbuds. I haven't had them die on me and have used them for many hours at a time.\n\nMy issues with them are that sometimes the Bluetooth cuts out and I have to turn them off and back on to reset them. Also, my phone (iPhone 11) didn't originally go straight to Bluetooth, and when I manually set it, I've been told that the microphone quality isn't good (muffled, difficult to understand).\n\nI think these are a great pick for the price and useful as a university student.",
        "The noise cancellation function is excellent. It is good quality, simple to operate, and easy to carry. Using these headphones for listening to music makes me very happy; the headphones are very light, and wearing them for a few hours doesn't make me feel any uncomfortable. I can enjoy my music time and feel really good. Whenever my mood is low, I will wear it to listen to music for a while. I like this product a lot, and I will recommend it to my friends who also love to listen to music. The price is very affordable and reasonable; I recommend you guys buy it!!",
        "I use these for a noisy office environment. They are lightweight and comfortable. They don't eliminate all the noise, but definitely make it easier to concentrate on my work!",
        "First pair didn\u2019t work, easy return and ordered a new pair! Second pair work like a dream, crazy comfortable for my giant head and so pretty! Definitely would order again",

        "Sound quality is good for the money you paid. Love this because foldable & lay flat. Good for the trip use.\nNot yet have chance to test the noise cancellation on the flight.",

        "I\u2019ve been looking for some better earbuds than the Jabra Elite Active 65t\u2019s I\u2019ve been using the last couple years. The T16\u2019s from Bmani are a huge improvement, and here is why:\n\n1: Bass! My main reason for wanting a different ear Bud was the Jabras had zero bass. Harder music was sadly reproduced.\n\n2: Clarity. I listened to these today for the first time, and I heard several song lyrics I had never heard before. It was really wild to understand something I had missed hundreds of times before.\n\n3: Fit. My Jabra\u2019s stayed in pretty good, even when onewheeling off-road in bumpy conditions. However, the Bmani set feels like I could do backflips and they\u2019d stay put. Comfortably, I might add!\n\n4: These can be used with one earbud or both! This is a game changer. I can now have one in and listen to music but still hear my wife talking to me. (The music would stop if I put one of them in the case with the Jabra unit.) Two people could even share, I suppose!\n\n5: As a result of the single earbud mode, each earbud has independent volume and multifunction buttons. Very intuitively designed! In fact, I put the earbuds in before looking closely at them, and I was able to turn up the volume up just assuming the buttons were what they are. You can tell the designers of these also used them.\n\n6: The charging case! Ok, the case feels like cheap plastic. But, it is super functional! It even shows the power level of each earbud!\n\nIn short, these are fantastic earbuds for $75, but they\u2019re way cheaper than that.",
        "I got these to use at the gym and they work fine.\n\nThe battery life is pretty good, I've never had them die on me as far as I can remember.\n\nThey're pretty comfortable - I can't do ear buds, they just don't stay in my ear, but the loops on these actually make them stay relatively well.\n\nThe case is nice and compact, charges quickly and shows you the battery life inside it.\n\nThe controls on the side are easy to use, I feel sometimes those buttons don't work well but these are good.\n\nThe noise cancellation is questionable, it's maybe a liiiittle better than normal earbuds but if you didn't tell me they had the feature, I probably wouldn't have noticed.\n\nThe audio quality isn't great, about as good the default apple earpods, but I didn't get them for that.\n\nMy only real issue ive run into is that after about 4-5 months of having them, the case has stopped closing all the way and so one of them doesn't fully connect to the case. This means that it doesn't charge consistently, and worse - my phone will randomly connect to them when they're in my bag, sometimes even connect to them in the car, switching off my car Bluetooth which is annoying as hell.\nI fixed this issue by folding a half of a tissue and putting it in the case and putting a hair tie around it. This keeps the earbud in place and works fine. Obviously not ideal but it's not the absolute end of the world. And for the price I feel like I got my money's worth pretty well.",
        "I almost bought a really expensive pair, but honestly these work fine, for both as headphones, and for taking calls on my phone. I don't really use the buttons much, so can't really speak to those! The charging case is such a great touch - I have used these every day with my laptop for a few weeks and haven't really had to charge it yet. (I'm not doing anything that would use a ton of battery like listening to music - I'm mostly just working on my laptop and streaming the occasional meeting.) They pair easily, and the sound is great! Don't know that I need anything more than that! One point to note is that \"noise canceling\" is one of the features you can rate in this review, but I didn't rate it good or bad, since these are not noise canceling. That being said, when I'm using these with my computer, I only wear one in my ear because otherwise I can't hear anything around me.\n\nAlso, I want to mention that they fit my very small ears perfectly! I don't \"plug\" them fully into my ears, because they wouldn't stay in my small ear canals anyway, but the wraparound feature works great. I've even worn them to do an online workout! The plastic is soft and they are very comfortable. If I wear them all day, my ears will start to get a tiny bit sore, but nothing terrible and I'm sure I'll become accustomed to them.\n\nI'd buy these again!",

        "I purchased them primarily for use on a Windows PC for Discord voice communication. Unfortunately the sound quality was not great and the speakers would actually vibrate on my head from time to time when sound came through which I found uncomfortable and sometimes even startled me. When I would talk others said I frequently sounded like a distorted robot or my voice was cutting in and out. There are very few settings for controlling sound quality. I ended up returning this product for a refund. I got a totally different model of wireless headphones and they are working great so it's not my hardware that was the problem.",
        "Sound is perfect. Works without delay. Also very comfortable and stays in the ear well in movement.",

        "I'm a headphone enthusiast. Although, I have been through my fair share of headphones and earphones, I can definitely say without a doubt that these headphones are one of the best ones I've had. I had always bought Beats headphones because honestly I was buying the brand so people knew I was wearing trendy headphones but after a few uses of the Beats studio 3 wireless, the cushion started to peel off. Not only that, it affected the audio and it sounded mushy and really bad. It was hurting my ears. Yes, they were comfortable but after a long time they started to feel uncomfortable. Anyways, back to these headphones. In terms of cushion, it doesn't peel at all. I am a very sweaty dude and every headphone and earphone has stopped working after a few months because of sweat (I'm guessing) but these really did last long. They are rather uncomfortable, my left ear always ends up hurting the most even when I adjust them so the only issue I have with them is that when I'm trying to relax they always end up hurting my ear when I wear them too long.\n\nThe sound is crisp and clean. I was honestly expecting a raunchy sound from cheap headphones but boy oh boy was I incorrect. These headphones proved me wrong and they really show that even after workout sessions, they truly are a top quality headphone material.\nNoise cancellation was also very very good. I can barely hear anything even when my volume is rather low. It's a good thing when you're in a library trying to listen to your music at a somewhat silent rate and at the same time, not hearing people around you whisper to each other. It really does do its justice and lives up to its expectations.\nAll in all, these headphones are amazing for such a cheap price. The sound is amazing, the ease of buttons is amazing, the fact that you can change the quality of sound is amazing, everything about these headphones are amazing. The only thing I would change is the comfortableness of the cushion because they kinda hurt after a while. Maybe it's my ears but hopefully for the next person they are okay with that feature. I recommend these headphones over any beats headphones out there without a doubt. Take it from me who spent about $320 on one pair. I could've bought these and extra pairs if another one stopped functioning rather than spending $200 on repairs for Beats. New buyers of sport headphones or any headphone users. PLEASE BUY THESE HEADPHONES! :D",
        "left them in the car for two to three days and still had enough charge for the gym for a couple of hours. Once i started to play my music I heard absolutely nothing. The best headphones for the price.",
        "They feel like kids dollar store headphones but the sound is clear and the Bluetooth connection works for a good distance. Perfect for the gym cause I would rather forget these at the gym then my beats. Also sweat will destroy the leather on the beats and this are still in tact after a few cardio sessions. Easy to connect. The buttons are kind of useless to me",
        "so i think the age of me wearing airpods is over (just kidding, i have them on reserve for when these run out of battery) which prompted me to buy noise cancelling over-the-ear headphones. i was not disappointed.\n\nnot only are these extremely stylish, but they're cheap too. for the quality put into these, i wouldn't be surprised if they were over twenty. alas, the poor kids are in luck. they're very generous when you put them on, and when they're off, you can hang them around your neck no problem. they're super comfortable as well, given that the plush leather on the inside keeps your ears from feeling muffled. now if only i had that but for my gaming headphones.\n\nthe battery life lasts for quite some time and it's okay if you forget to turn off the headphones like i do on occasion because they do turn off automatically. if i had the space, i'd definitely buy another one just for the hell of it.",
        "Of course they are cheap and mine broke after a drop off an end table but the sound is decent",
        "I would like to start off being honest, these headphones are waterproof. You can shower with these things on (DO NOT SUBMERGE THIS HEADPHONES IN WATER, THESE ARE NOT FOR SWIMMING). And that's really the only good thing about it. When I received my headphones, the left earphone was already quieter than the right. I tried switching between mono and stereo sound to make a difference but it did nothing. The sound quality is not good to put it nicely. Even with the right headphone being the loudest, any earbuds or wires I ever had out did these headphones. After two days of using these headphones, I couldn't take it anymore and went to look inside the earphones. I find one of the wires thinning because the manufacturer did not add enough glue to make it stick. I found two wires thinner then shredded paper inside. When I tried to move the open earphone around to see if I could see anything else, the poorly glued wire popped off. So now my left earphone is permanently broken (Yes I tried to use foil and glue myself to fix it) and I'm waiting for a refund. Sure, you can say that my headphones were just a manufacturing mistake and buy them to see for yourself. But trust me random stranger, you DO NOT want these headphones! They may be cheap, but literally spending 10$ or even 5$ more can get you something 3x better.\n\nTo the manufactures if you are reading this, this product has A LOT of potential. You have the SD card, the radio, noise cancellation, and the battery life. The only problem is that these headphones are WAY too cheap! Please upgrade the wiring (please make them thicker, and maybe add more wiring if needed), and the sound quality (make the speakers, bigger, better, and louder). And maybe you can change the plastic casing of the headphones to make them feel less cheap, but I never really had a problem with that. I know these upgrades more than likely will raise the price of these headphones a little. But you should consider it because I had headphones and earbuds miles better than this for 5$ more.\n\nI STRONGLY recommend to anyone thinking to buy this product, please go for something above 20 dollars. You will not regret spending your money on headphones that can last you months (or years) for something 5$ more than this!"

        "These headphones are awesome! Originally, I was looking for Bose-like headphones. I bought BOHM ones (off of Amazon) to try, and ended up returning them because there was no visible noise-cancellation (and they were close to $100). These have better noise cancellation - they definitely do not silence people around you, but they do make things quieter, even without music playing. With music playing, you can pretty much zone out, which is pretty much perfect. I've also tried a more expensive pair of Sony Headphones (they were close to $200) - I would say that the noise-cancelling feature is pretty much the same... at least, I didn't notice much of a difference between the two quality-wise. The more expensive Sonys were better quality in terms of material, look, and the speakers encapsulate your ears more effectively. But for the price, I would overwhelmingly choose these ones!\nAs an example, I'm currently writing this review in my apartment with the dish washer and dryer running... they're pretty loud. When I flip the noise-cancel switch (I don't have any music playing), the humming is gone, but I can still hear the swishing of the water in the dishwasher.\nThese headphones are perfect for when you're on the 'quiet' floor of the library, and that one person starts eating a bag of carrots... ugh that's the worst!\nI also like how they fold up, I'm in college, so I just smoosh them into my backpack. They're much more comfortable than earbuds for studying, they don't hurt your ears.\nSide note: I definitely prefer these to bluetooth headphones - you don't need to charge them, all you need is a single battery.\n\nOverall, I'm very happy with my purchase. These are inexpensive, functional, and have great sound quality!",
        "Good noise cancelling for the price. We use it on all our international flights and it definitely muffles all sounds. Hard to sleep with since they are bulky, but we still love it.",
        "Compared to a set of Beats headphones, this is a good if not exceptional set of over-the-ear headphones. Recently I acquired a digital practice saxophone which, for latency reasons, only uses analog headphones for private practice so the Bluetooth only Beats wouldn\u2019t work. Ear buds are not for me so I went looking for traditional wired headphones which are getting more rare as wireless technology gets better. That Sony now offers noise-reduction at a such a low price is an added benefit that I was keen to try out. The noise-reduction does work but at a much lesser level than you might get with more expensive headphones. Whether this is because of the hardware or because the ear muffs don\u2019t isolate as well, I can\u2019t say. Sound quality is decent, nothing great but nothing horrible either. For $30 this is a good deal.",
        "They actually did moderate noise cancelling on the plane with the switch turned on. I use them a lot with the ROKU and the sound is great off the TV. nBattery lasts a long time if you remember to shut ir off after use.",
        "I ordered these on a co-workers recommendation, but they may go back. Though comfortable for my couple hour long testing, the sound quality doesn't cut it for me. With power off the sound is dull & flat. Turning on power boosts the volume & adds a little clarity to the sound. I compared power on & off in various levels of constant background noise from a running fridge to a loud bathroom exhaust fan. With or without music playing the noise reduction was minimal. I don't expect them to match high end/priced models, but these don't cut down enough steady sound to stay in my bag of headphones. I hate to spend the money, but the $350 Sony phones did wonders to almost all the background noise in Best Buy... If only there were a middle ground for $100 to $200.\n\nUpdate 2018.04.27: I've used these at work for a few days now. I rotate skiing these, old Bose, and new Mpow 059 phones. The 10 year old Bose sound better than the others, but let in too much external noise. We have a wire noise system at work that these Sony phones can't overcome. They got a bit uncomfortable after 6 hours or so. Still good sound for price though a pad where they sit on top of the head would be a nice addition.\n\nUpdate 2018.04.30: The most maddening thing about these that I somehow neglected to point out is that the battery cover falls (fell) off almost daily and today I didn't notice and lost it somewhere. Now what?! Wish I returned them while I had all the parts.",
        "These work very well and I'm excited that I tried them. And for the price they can't be beat. I do have to say that the noise cancelling is a bit weak but I compared them to 250.00 types so that isn't really fair. They do give some relief but in general the calls and sound is very clear and better than a pair that I paid over twice for. If you are on a tight budget and you need phones with these features then these are a winner.",

        "These have the most solid and premium build quality of any headphone I've tested in this price range ($200-350). The leather is beautiful and supple, the metal arms seem bombproof, and the plastic used for the earcups is of the highest quality. I love that the leather is used for the earcups, which allows for a cool, very comfortable sensation against the head, as well as the headband. The Fidelio L3 logo is subtly embossed at the center of the headband. The earcups are perfect circles, giving the headphones an elegant and timeless design.\n\nIn short, I love these headphones.\n\nOf course, in this category of high-end ANC headphones, the benchmark is the Sony XM4. I have been testing these Fidelios against my new (Dec 2021) Sony XM4s. In terms of build quality, these L3s *blow the Sony's out of the water.* By comparison, the Sony's feel cheap and like they'll crack at any moment - and, in fact, there are a number of reviewers who have ran into exactly that problem. (Take a look at the numerous images of cracked and useless XM4s on their Amazon page.) The Sony's seem to have a structural weakness at the pivot where the earcup connects to the headband, and too many people for me to feel comfortable with have reported the headphones snapping at that point. Sony customer service refuses to repair or replace these, even if it's within warranty, because they consider it \"damage.\" This has practical consequences; if I want to take a nap with my headphones on, I always choose the Fidelios because the Sony's make me afraid that if I turn on my side and put pressure against the earcup, they will snap. At this price point, Sony should be doing much, much better. My opinion is that Sony has become accustomed to the fact that everyone seems to consider the XM4s the best-in-class, and, as a result, the company has become lazy, seeking to maximize their margins by using cheap plastics, fake leather, and generally neglecting the build quality.\n\nCan you imagine dropping $350 on your headphones, only to have them snap on you within a year? That's insane.\n\nSo, in short, the Fidelios seem to me to offer the best build quality of any headphones in this price range. I think I'll be able to throw them into my bag when I'm rushing off to work or traveling for years to come and not worry about any damage. They are that solid. They are a pleasure to hold and look at.\n\nWith all of that said, the Fidelios are not as excellent when it comes to the sound and ANC. I can tell that the XM4s have better noise cancelling than the Fidelios. Even worse, I have noticed a very subtle high pitched tone coming from the Fidelios at times, mostly when the volume is up high. I'm still testing to see whether it's a problem with my Bluetooth connection or audio player, but I think it may simply be a defect.\n\nThe other issue I've noticed is that the mic on the Fidelios hasn't been super clear on my Zoom calls. (I'm on a 2018 Surface 6 Tablet, so that may have something to do with it.) That's a major drawback for me, but it's not an issue when they are plugged in. I also have about 5 or 6 Bluetooth connections going on at the same time and that's caused connectivity issues with the Sony's too, so I need to continue testing once I've reduced the number of Bluetooth connections. When I remove the other Bluetooth connections, I haven't had issues.\n\n(In case you run into the same issue, there is a reliable workaround: Get yourself a BT receiver, such as the TP-Link USB Bluetooth Receiver. The issue seems to stem from the BT connections interfering with each other.)\n\nThis is the first year that the Fidelios have been out and I am confident that with the next iteration, Philips will get better at the ANC. I expect these headphones to quickly overtake the XM4s in the years to come. They just need to develop the audio quality. Philips has phenomenal sound quality on some of its other headphones, such as the open-backed Fidelio X2HRs, which I also love. (The soundstage and overall sound quality on these is noticeably better than the XM4s and Fidelio L3s.) The question is whether the headphone review industry will move on from its fixation on the XM4s, as far as public recognition goes.\n\nI highly recommend these headphones, but you will need to test them with your actual use-cases to figure out whether they match what matters most to you.",
        "This headset is amazing when it works, BUT, my unit came extremely bad:\nWear sensor doesn't actually works, it pauses the reproduction when you lower or unwear the headset, but it doesn't turn it on when you wear again, need to restart the device everytime, so decided to just disable that feature every time I switch the headset on\nMulti link works 50% of the time, the other 50% it can't get paired with laptop and smartphone at the same time, no matter how many times I try to pair, or how many combinations of \"laptop first - smartphone first\" I do\nNow it suddenly started to auto shutoff while playing media, for no reason, again need to restart the device and sometimes, to re-pair.\n\nSo to make a resume:\nPros: amazing sound, really well build quality and transport bag+case, really confortable, ANC works great on all modes, lots of playtime per charge and it charges pretty quickly\n\nCons: mobile app its really slugish (even on a top-of-the-line smartphone), audio cable is REALLY thin (really, like half the diameter of a classic audio cable); and at least on my unit, multilink not working, same as wear sensor, and that random shutoffs\n\n(Yes I tried to contact to Philips, but NEVER got a reponse)",
        "I was in the market to replace some Soundcore Q30s that I got a few years of use out of. I really enjoyed them, however, they fell apart beyond what electrical tape and super glue could remedy. In a market saturated with low to mid priced options and questioning Soundcore's build quality, I embarked on a quest for a serviceable pair of headphones for under $100. After going 0/3, I took a shot in the dark with the Philips TAH 9505 headphones. I purchased them used for $42 and change on Amazon. Result: Pleasantly surprised! The sound quality is better than the Q30s IMO, especially in the mid to high ranges. The pads for the ears are thick and quite comfortable, though the phones clamp a little tight. ANC is good enough for me, while the cups seal quite well, eliminating the need for ANC in many situation. All that being said, if you're frustrated by the lack of solid and affordable options, give these a try.",
        "These are some very good headphones, overall. They have good sound quality, they\u2019re pretty easy to pair, and they have pretty long battery life. The noise canceling isn\u2019t the best, but they cut out a decent amount of sound. The case that they come with is simple, but it\u2019s very nice. However, they do have some flaws. They aren\u2019t the most comfortable, as I\u2019ve found that I have to take them off and wait a bit before I can wear them again. They also have some mild inconveniences about them, like the obnoxious touch controls, and that they make weird noises once in a while. Despite that, though, these are overall very good. I recommend them",
        "These arrived a day earlier than expected and I was so excited to test them out. So far, the L3s perform very well for the price, noise cancellation is very effective, and it sounds really good with all the songs I've tested on it, it also works quite well for gaming which is sort of a given, however my only complaints thus far is that I can't seem to use these plugged into my PC via both USB-C and the included audio jack, both of which are fairly thin cables, overall though I would recommend these just for their performance alone.",
        "Me encantaron.. buen sonido y muy c\u00f3modos.",
        "",
        "First the good. Sound is very good, I like the \"Awareness On\" mode so I can hear people talking to me, and it is comfortable and has a long battery life.\nOk, construction materials for the headband - fire the engineer who selected a brittle spring material. Mine broke in 2 audible cracks right in the middle after a few months. Fortunately it still holds ok on my head, but honestly, they did zero durability testing on this. That is not what I expected from Philips.\nNow there is a software app that you need to download to get to some of the options. No one from Phillips did any product testing with any significant cross section of real users.\n1. On-headset buttons don't always work. For example the button turning awareness on, or more frequently the TouchPad sensor does not pause or raise volume etc. To fix this I need the software interface on my Samsung S20 FE phone and toggle touchpad sensor on/off switch. This software sometimes will not boot up, and I need to close and reopen the software. Then every time it takes at least 24 seconds to start.\nPhilips is proud of their \"wear sensor\". This is supposed to pause whenever you remove the headset. That would be great, but mine also pauses if I tip my head forward or move my head too fast, and then it doesn't resume. I have to hold my hand over the TouchPad sensor as a hack to resue play, but at this point it is even more sensitive and pauses for very minor movements. Way too sensitive. So I usually turn off the wear sensor - which doesn't always work right away.\nBut headphones are forgetful you see, and so next time you turn them on, it assumes it knows what you want - which is its default settings. NC on -not awareness on as I last used, wear sensor on - not off like I prefer, so I will fiddle with the buttons to get what I want. Honestly, does 8 bits of memory cost too much or did no one consider users would like to save their last settings?",
        "I bought these headphones for my wife for her birthday for her to use in her office for meetings and listening to music. The sound was great and so was the microphone but only a few months after we bought them the plastic on the side cracked and the headphone would no longer sit flush to her ear. This is after only regular wear and tear in a controlled environment. For over 200 dollars I can't believe they were this cheaply made! My children have 20 dollar headphones that haven't broken like this after being sat on and dropped over and over again. Buyer beware!\n\nI tried to use Philips warranty to replace the headphones. It was like a black hole of emails and phone calls between 3 different departments. I was feeling stubborn so I persisted for 3 months in following up and checking to make sure our case was being dealt with but after 3 months we were told the warranty doesn't cover wear and tear. So that was that... I can't say how disappointed I am in what I thought was a great company.",
        "The noise cancelling was not well enough for my taste. I was still able to hear my husband talking while I was listening to my music. The sound was very good. I did find the ears on the headset were heavy. My biggest complaint was that the only way to increase and decrease the volume or skip songs was on the ear set. All you had to do was swipe your finger across, up or down on the ear piece. If you didn\u2019t touch it in the exact spot or if your swipe was a little off. Sometime when I swiped up to increase the sound it would not work. When I wanted to skip a song it would replay instead of skip. I found that very frustrating. Maybe it was because the touch pad was too sensitive. The quality was there, just not practical. I did return it"

        "I have been using these headphone for a couple of weeks now and I must say I\u2019m very pleased by the purchase. They connected easily to Bluetooth. The sound quality and tonal range are very good. The active noise canceling works remarkably well and the unidirectional sensitivity of the microphone is excellent. They are light to wear and seem very comfortable after several hours and have a long battery life for music and voice. The case that comes with them is small and sturdy. Overall I have to say they are the best headphone sets I have used (or the price.",
        "These headphones are exceptional value for their cost of only $50. Serving as an integral part of my professional setup at a video production studio, these headphones have proven their very impressive sound quality in my editing work. I\u2019ve also been using them for gaming on my Steam Deck. Especially impressive is the device's battery life, offering a personally verified 30 hours of continuous playback time.\n\nThe design merits recognition for its well-thought-out user experience, it\u2019s lightweight frame allows comfort for an entire day's wear without imposing discomfort, credited to its super soft imitation protein leather padding. The simple connectivity afforded by the choice of Bluetooth and wired options simplifies the user experience (My mother who is NOT good with technology was able to connect instantly with her iPad pro). The design of these are also great. Easily adjustable with a sleek aesthetic design holding its own against more prominent brands. The product package is complete with a user guide, charging cable, a 3.5mm aux cable, and a handy portable case (That I\u2019ve been using to bring to work). All in all, I highly recommend them.",
        "These headphones are by far the best Noise isolating ANC I have personally come across, and the ENC microphones make calls are crystal clear!\n\nUsing the app you can really fine tune how you want them to sound, with 3 different options for ANC, and several EQ options for music\n\nYou can also use the buttons on the right headphone to toggle the ANC settings without using the app, as well as buttons for volume control, and the power on/off button.\n\nMy first pair worked incredibly for a few days and were going to be my new daily headphones, but sadly wouldn't charge up again around 6 days in. Absolutely bummed about this I contacted the company and let them know what happened and they sent me a replacement pair!\n\nThey just arrived today and sound just as amazing as the first pair did!\n\nSuch an amazing company and such an underrated pair of headphones, I couldn't recommend these more they outpace many high end headphones on the market right now for a much better price.",

        "I needed noise-canceling headphones for an upcoming flight because I\u2019m a nervous flyer and thought they would help. I rarely fly so I thought I\u2019d see if I could find some decent ones at a lower price. These had good reviews, but I made the rookie mistake of not reading the bad ones, too. Here\u2019s my experience:\n\nPros\nReceived them on time\nThey\u2019re pretty comfortable\nThe case is nice and the headphones curl up nicely in it\n\nCons\nAnytime you power it on/off, connect/disconnect Bluetooth, or turn on/off the noise-canceling, a woman\u2019s voice screams it out at you. It startled me and I didn\u2019t even have them on my ears yet, I can\u2019t imagine what it sounds like when you\u2019re wearing them.\n\nThey ask you to download an app called SoundCloud - it has a grand total of 2 reviews as I\u2019m writing this on 10/03/23 and there\u2019s one star. Needless to say I didn\u2019t download it.\n\nYou can scan a QR code to get an \u201cextended warranty\u201d - but the only way to complete it is to give a review. How can I review something I\u2019ve never used? So I skipped that, too. I guess I could\u2019ve waited until after I tried them out, but I\u2019ve never had a company require a review to get the warranty before so I was suspicious.\n\nThere\u2019s a card in the case that offers something free if you leave a five star rating with \u201cno words and no photos\u201d, then take a screenshot of the review and send that and your order ID to an Outlook email address. I\u2019ve been an Amazon shopper for many years and never seen anything like that before - makes me question every good review on here.\n\nThe \u201cnoise-canceling\u201d is laughable. It even says in the instructions for use that it only works for low-frequency noise and not high-frequency, like human voices. You get what you pay for so I guess I should\u2019ve kept my expectations low.\n\nReturning these things was a hassle. I couldn\u2019t drop it off at the local Amazon drop off merchant where you literally hand over the product, they scan the QR code in the app, and that\u2019s it - I had to package it up, print out and tape the return label on the box, and drop it off at UPS. First world problem, I know. But it was still a waste of my time.",

The headphones provided crystal-clear sound, making it easy for my child to enjoy his favorite music and watch videos during the long plane ride.\n\nAdditionally, the headphones' durability and sturdiness were evident throughout the trip. Despite being used by a playful and energetic 7-year-old, they held up remarkably well, showing no signs of wear and tear.\n\nAnother feature I appreciated was the foldable design, making it easy to store the headphones in our carry-on bag without taking up much space. It added to the convenience of travel and ensured that the headphones remained protected during transit.\n\nIn conclusion, the iClever HS19 Kids Headphones with Microphone proved to be a fantastic investment for our long plane ride.

I highly recommend them to parents looking for high-quality headphones for their kids!",
        "I've bought several of these for my kids. Love them, but have had to replace two of them in a year's time. One broke when my son was taking them off (could entirely be him being rough on them, but alas, they still broke) and the mic went out on one other pair. Still like them, love that they fold up, have microphones and sturdy, cloth-covered cords. They're also comfortable for my kids.",
        "We ordered one for our son, age 6, for when we travel. We were impressed with how well it works. We also like that it has ear protection, as well as the option to make it louder for ambient noise like on airplanes. We ordered another one for him to use at school, and we also ordered one for his sister. The one we ordered for school broke recently, and it was still under a year. So we contacted customer service, and they were fantastic! They replied quickly, attempted to troubleshoot the issue, and then they sent us a replacement for our broken one, when it was clear it couldn\u2019t be fixed. For the price, quality, and service- buying this is a no-brainer. And the other headphones we have from them for longer have had no issues and work well. Highly recommend.",

The size/fit was also great for my kid (8) at the smallest setting. And I myself was able to wear them when both sides were extended to the fullest (gives about 1 inch additional height on both sides). As mentioned because I was able to put them on my head, I was able to confirm the volume was at an acceptable level.\n\nA couple more things I hope to test in the next little while would be the button control (start/stop/skip music) and the \"listen together\" jack. will report back when that is done :) Will also see how it holds up to real life kid usage.\n\nColors are a nice pastel shade and my daughter loves it. Still a little bulky when folded together and the cord is long (necessary but I also foresee spaghetti mess) but we put it into our own drawstring bag so she can keep it in a bundle. If one was included that would have been icing on the cake.",

The ear and head padding are nice'n soft ,, she was wearing these as soon as they were delivered and watched one of her films which was about 1hr 35minutes long with no problems , she didnt get any ear ache which you sometimes get when wearing these type of headphones squashing the ears, because they are softly padded , she also liked the control button on the lead so she could pause and unpause the film when needed :) overhaul she's happy with them ,.As an adult I also found them to be comfortable to wear with ther adjustments easily made either side , They do have a nice clear crisp sound and decent bass tone ... we was using a samsung tablet",

        "I was concerned at first because the outside of the box said these headphones were great for kids 3+. I immediately thought (before I even opened the box), that I was probably going to have to return them. But after opening it, I was happy that the size was similar to most other headphones. I tried them on and I was surprised at how soft and comfortable the cushion was. I was able to plug it into a computer (Mac and PC) and there weren't any issues. The buttons to adjust the volume were functional and the sound was clear. The ultimate test was when the actual owner of the headset (the kid of course), was excited immediately because of how the color popped. He also \"LOVED\" how the cushion felt. It seems durable and I appreciate that it folds quite easily. For the cost, it's definitely a great choice for kids that need to bring in headphones at school.",
        "I bought these for my daughter to wear for computer time and schoolwork. They are comfortable and feel sturdy. I love that they fold even a little. The cord is thick and doesn't seem flimsy nor easily breakable at the connection point into the headphones. The sound quality is great. Really happy with these. We just purchased them so I can't speak to how long they'll last but I'm hoping to get at least a few more months out of them than some I've purchased in the past. School kids can be rough on these headsets....so I'll update once we've used them a while.",

I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll grow into them, but I wish she could make them a little bit smaller",

I thought that these were just bluetooh headphones, but they also come with two headphone jacks; with and without a microphone! The audio quality is amazing, and they're super comfy and adjustable. They are noise canceling for the most part, if you don't have audio playing then they aren't completely noise canceling, but other than that, these are the best headphones ever!!",
        "Alright. Usually I'm a bit too lazy to right reviews but I just gotta say these are great.\nI have some higher quality pricier over the ear headphones and I keep reverting back to using these. They're light, comfortable, the battery life is great and they look awesome.\nPlus I'm noticing the range of the Bluetooth seems to be better than my higher price headphones. I can leave my phone in my bedroom and be out in the living room and these stay connected while my higher price headphones seem to cut out at that distance.\nPlus, these seem to sit on my head better than my more expensive headsets too.\nHonestly I got these because they were a cheaper option at the time, but I still use these just about daily and only end up using my higher prices headphones while this set is charging.\nThis is by far the best headset I have.",
        "I bought these headphones to see how they stood up to the Skullcandy Crusher Evo Headphones.\n\nThough they are just as attractive and really comparable, the sound quality on them isn't as solid. They are a good option for 1/3 off the price. They are also more comfortable in that they are lighter on the head for long term wear and they come with a sturdier case - which were pluses.\n\nThey connect easily to bluetooth and are a great budget friendly option, though I chose to splurge on the SC.\n\nWell done! Recommended based on budget and usage.",
        "I bought a pair of these for my son and a pair for myself. They are really good headphones overall; comfy with good sound quality, but we both agree the battery life could be better.",
        "I adore these headphones. Very comfortable, they cancel sounds so I can block out my older sister, battery charge is excellent, mic quality is great, I can call my grandma and she can hear me clearly. Plus the snake pattern, I love it! If I'm satisfied with how long I can use them before they retire, I'll come get another!",
        "They sound great to me. But I'm no expert on soud quality, so my satisfaction may be your disappointment. Bass is there but not as extreme as the description makes it sound.\n\nBattery life is average. My last pair could go four days of continuous use on one full charge whereas this one barely just barely makes it to 48 hours. Might do you better if you use your headphones less often than I do.\n\nWhen I used these headphones with my HP Laptop (especially on Youtube or similiar video hosting sites) I have to be careful not to pause the media too often or leave it pause to long, because when I press play again no sound will come through the heaphones even though its connected and the video is clearly playing. I used to be able to fix this by refreshing the page but that stopped working, so now I have to disconnect the bluetooth entirely and connect it again to fix it. I don't have this issue when connected to my phone.\n\nThe play/pause and foward/backward buttons on the headphones do not work on Youtube on my phone. Only volume commands work. However, my phone is a geriatric mess by smartphone standards so this might not be a problem with more recent models.\n\nAll in all, could do better but not entirely awful for 48 dollars.

        "I've been a loyal fan of the JLab JBuddies Studio On-Ear Kids Wired Headphones for years, and they have never let me down. These headphones have become a staple for my twins, both at home and school, and here's why I give them a well-deserved 5-star rating:\n\n1. **Durability:** These headphones are built to withstand the wear and tear of active kids. Over the years, they've endured countless drops, tugs, and twists and are still going strong. That kind of durability is hard to beat!\n\n2. **Comfortable Fit:** My twins find these headphones comfortable to wear for extended periods. The on-ear design is just the right size for their little ears and provides a secure fit without being too tight.\n\n3. **Safe Volume Levels:** I appreciate the built-in volume control that ensures my kids' delicate ears are protected. It's a reassuring feature for a parent.\n\n4. **Tangle-Free Cord:** The tangle-free cord design is a small but appreciated detail. It saves us from the frustration of untangling knots every time they want to use their headphones.\n\n5. **Clear Sound:** Despite being budget-friendly, these headphones deliver surprisingly clear and crisp sound quality, allowing my kids to enjoy their music, movies, or educational content without any compromise.\n\n6. **Priced Right:** The affordability of these headphones is a major plus. I've bought multiple pairs over the years, and it doesn't break the bank.\n\n7. **Variety of Colors:** The availability of different colors is a nice touch, allowing my twins to pick their favorite and express their individuality.\n\nIn summary, the JLab JBuddies Studio On-Ear Kids Wired Headphones have been a reliable and cost-effective choice for my twins. They're built to last, comfortable to wear, and offer peace of mind with safe volume levels. I highly recommend them to other parents looking for durable and reasonably priced headphones for their kids. These headphones easily earn a 5-star rating!",
        "We love these headphones for our little one. He's got a pair for at home and a pair that was sent in to school for their media/computer time there. Flexible and durable - they've held up really well to a lot of use.",
        "From the child for whom they were purchased: \"They're really good; they work on my iPad [at school].\"",
        "For the price these are great quality kids headphones. We bought these things to replace more expensive headphones and we are now fans of these. Buy some for your kids. They work great!",
        "These fit my giant-headed almost-7 year old perfectly; probably with a little room to grow. They're comfortable and get the job done easily. They seem sturdy, too. Will update after he's used them for a while, we'll see how well they stand up to him. Thanks for a great looking product!\n\nPS - packaging was great too, nice and simple.",
        "So far so good. Just received this tonight and tested it out. It has very good audio quality for the price and purpose, and the volume limiting circuitry seems to do the job; the volume can get loud, but not loud enough to hurt the ears. I would still advise your child to exercise responsibility and only set the volume high enough to hear and no more, but it's nice to know it has that extra protection in case a device is capable of putting out too much volume and is set too high on initial activation. The look and construction are both very good, and I have high confidence this will perform well for its purpose in grade school. If it turns out to not be as durable as I expect, my review and rating here will change.\n\nThe fit is very good for a kid grade school that is beyond their toddler/kindergarten years.",
        "Good quality and sound",
        "I purchased these and some JBL JR 300 to gift to a younger family member. I decided to test both and see which would end up being the better headphones.\n\nThe JBuddies feel like they are made of stronger material, except the size adjustments sliders, which are just a couple of thin metal rods per side that seemed like they could get bent out of shape pretty easy. They also had a vulnerable point, the signal wires going to the ear cups are exposed and could snag on something or get pulled by absent minded fingers.\n\nThe JBL JR 300 felt a little more plasticky, not much more. Also the fake leather covering the ear pads felt thinner. However there were no vulnerable wires or any overt weak points and no exposed signal wires. The cord is not a round wire, it is flat like a ribbon which feels kind of thin compared to a traditional round wire.\n\nI used a basic sound meter (factory calibrated, not certified) to test how loud they would get. Quieter is safer for young ears, so lower dB is better. Safety standards that are often quoted claim 85dB is the upper limit for safe sound levels.\n\nThe JBuddies won out here, they wouldn't go past about 80dB no matter how much I tried to push them. The JBL JR 300 went right up to the line at 85dB.\n\nNext was sound quality, tested by having me and another family member listen to a variety of music.\n\nThe JBL JR 300 easily won this comparison. The sound was cleaner, clearer, and bass/midrange/treble were balanced very well. These sound like adult headphones, just not as loud.\n\nThe JBuddies had a touch too much midrange and lower treble. This gave them a sort of muffled sound. I found myself trying hard to hear some instrument, voice, or other sound.\n\nI ended up keeping the JBL JR 300, to gift to my family, and sending the JBuddies back. My reasoning was two-fold.\n\nFirst, the JBuddies thin metal rods and exposed signal wire don't inspire any confidence in it's ability to survive life with kids. The JBL JR 300 is a more solid structure and feels more kid-proof.\n\nSecond, while the JBuddies maxed out at a lower volume, the more muffled sound quality caused me to want to listen at the higher volumes just to try and hear things better. The JBL JR 300, being clean and clear allowed me to hear at lower volumes and did not make me feel the need to turn it up.\n\nWith a few adjustments, the JBuddies could be great kids headphones, I hope JLab refines them and puts out a better product in the future. I love their Retro Rewind Headphones, so I know they can put out something with more quality. Right now, the JBL JR 300 get my vote.",

        "Great sound, easy to pair. A little tight over my ears, but not bad. This is the 3rd pair of Power Locus headphones I have purchased. The other 2 were bought like 6 or 7 years ago, and still have great sound. I just got these because I wanted noise canceling ones for my trip(because parents feel entitled to subject everyone around them to the noise of their minis),and also because I couldn't find replacement earpads for the other set.",
        "These headphones produce excellent sound quality,,they are very comfortable to wear,, the design is simplistic which I appreciate,,, and they are very reasonably priced.",
        "Worked wonderfully for the first few months. Charging stopped working about 3 months in (so no more Bluetooth features), then one of the headphone jacks got bent about 6 months in (still not entirely sure how, there was never any unreasonable force applied to it), and then the sound finally stopped working for good 7 months in. All in all, a lifespan of just over half a year.\n\nSummary: sound quality was really nice while it lasted, connecting with devices was easy, the sound cancelation was really just sound muffling, and it was incredibly easy to break.\n\nUPDATE: customer service reached out and sent me a free replacement, which was incredibly generous. So far, the new ones work great, although they act a bit differently than the old ones. I think these headphones just vary a lot.",
        "With so many different options to chose from, I could not be happier with these wireless headphones! They come with a wire if needed and a great storage case but they were quite easy to set up as wireless headphones which I paired with my phone. The quality of the headphones themselves is great as well as the sound quality! The headphones expand to fit everyone in my family and the soft memory foam ear cups are really comfortable. I love the options in color and ordered the rose gold option. Great price for a great product!",

        "I do a lot of grocery shopping for my job and these have been amazing! Cancels the noises around me while I enjoy my music so I can focus.\nAlso easy to answer an incoming call with one button push and callers have said they can hear me great while in a busy public place.\nThe best part: The charge lasts so long. I Use them for a couple hours at a time nearly every day and haven\u2019t had to charge in weeks!\nAdjustable fit works well for me. My only complaint is my face gets a bit sweaty from the cushion material and it occasionally pulls my hair, but I imagine any similar product would probably do the same. Oh and the color is nice too. Worthy investment!",
        "The sound is amazing and my daughter loves the vibration of the bass. I have to say, I am totally impressed with these headphones. I bought them for my daughter and after using them am so jealous of how great they sound that I want to get a pair for myself. They are super stylish and just feel like quality. The sound is amazing, the 40 hours of charge time is ridiculous, and they are super comfortable. Phone calls are awesome and I especially love that you can use them with an included wired jack. Great for the PS4. Oh, and the carrying case is super sweet too. Way worth the price.",
        "Updated since I first reviewed:\nAfter having these for a few weeks I need to do another review. The sound overall is good, but the bass sometimes is just too much and gets distorted if set too high. It reminds me of when a subwoofer in the back of a car gives so much bass it can just distort the sound.\n\nAlso I am very annoyed that every single time I turn on my laptop I have to reset the bluetooth and pair it with the device. It's annoying to have to do this every time I want to use them.\nToday it was so frustrating that it took nearly 1 hour of trying to pair them with my laptop all over again. They just won't pair with my laptop anymore. I've tried everything. Unfortunately I have travelled out of the country and the cost to send these back as a return before the return date is too expensive.\nSo I will just deal with them. Now they are only connecting by bluetooth to my phone. so I will have to use a cord to connect with the laptop.\n\nFirst Review:\nThe headphones are very comfortable and the sound has been great for me so far. I use them to watch movies on my laptop or on my phone. Also when editing video content in Adobe Premier or using apps on my phone.\nNoise cancellation is not perfect. I still hear sounds.\n\nMy biggest issue is the Bluetooth doesn't stay connected to devices I have already paired it with. I am always having to pair it all over again after I haven't used it for a few hours or a couple of days. My old headphones which were a cheap $20 pair never had this issue with pairing.",

        "My 3.5-year-old son loves these headphones and they're great for long car or airplane rides (kids' shows can be maddening in a confined space). They work well, have amazing battery life, and the sound quality is good. I appreciate the decibel limit on it. It's nice not having to worry about my son accidentally damaging his hearing by cranking the volume up too high. The flashing colorful lights look great and make it fun for my son to wear the headphones. My only complaint is that the controls are a little hard to use because it's very difficult to see the symbols on the buttons. They are small and they're the same color as the body of the headphones around them. Making them a different/contrasting color or even making them back-lit would be a huge improvement and make them much easier to use. It's frustrating trying to figure out which button is which in the backseat of a dark car at night. Overall, however, they're a great product for the price.",

        "I bought these for my son for Christmas last year. I also bought a pink pair for my daughter\u2026. My daughter\u2019s still work and I\u2019ve never had an issue out of them. My sons on the other hand only lasted about 6 months at best quality. After 6 months they started to not hold a charge very long, maybe 2 hours. I started to notice the lights being on while he was using them so I would turn the lights off. But then I found out about a month ago that the button to turn the lights off doesn\u2019t work and when you press it, it makes a very bad screeching sound for a few seconds, like it\u2019s trying to connect to a bluetooth. These head phones were really good, until they weren\u2019t. And now I\u2019m having to buy replacements.",

Not to mention uncomfortable.\n\nI will be returning this product due to the issues above but also because the moment I got it on it not only flashed by had a horrendously loud static sound.

        "We have an old TV and this worked really well. The ear pads are comfortable, the sound is great, especially for us with hearing problems.",
        "I nearly returned these. The RCA audio jacks on my TV are input only. Using the 3.5mm audio out line works perfectly.\n\nI noticed the sound cutting out now and then and it turns out that happens when I recline and the receiving antenna in the part of the headset that goes over my head can't see the transmit antenna. For some reason my head blocks the signal but I can walk all over my house and still hear. Works great. No notable delay or latency. I cancelled the return. I am glad I didn't return them.",
        "It\u2019s was really easy to set up but I learned I didn\u2019t have the correct audio setting on my tv so I didn\u2019t work immediately. Sounds better than my gaming headphones with less interference for about the same price. The sound is clear and goes up super loud which is good for me as I am hard of hearing. The range is awesome around my entire house. I wish it had a mute button but other than that I\u2019m happy",
        "2nd unit I\u2019ve owned. Started having trouble with on switch on first pair after 2 years+ and headband needed electrical tape over some padding. 1st pair still mostly works. Bonus - both pair can be used simultaneously- but one set will not work if second is being charged on charger hooked to TV.",
        "This was DOA out of the box. Tried everything and could not get it to work. Before getting it ready for it's return trip to Amazon, I tried substituting another mini-plug cable that I had laying around and , voila! It now works fine. So the supplied mini-plug cable was defective.\n\nThat issue resolved, this is really a pretty nice headphone setup. It was dead simple to set up. Installing the provided rechargeable battery into the headphones was a little tricky, but not a big deal. The sound quality is quite good - the \"speech\" setting boosts the treble a bit to make things a little easier to understand. The volume control on the headphone is a little tight to move, but I just left it a 5 and use the volume control on the TV which gives me all the range I need. Note that this will probably work only if you are using the headphone jack on the TV for the input. The headphones are pretty comfortable - not too much pressure on your ears, but still fit snugly enough to block out most outside noise. My only gripe is the indicator light on the charging base. It lights up red when the headphones are charging, but then extinguishes when the charge is complete. It would be nice if it would turn green to show a full charge.\n\nI would give it 5 starts, but I'm deducting one star for a lax quality control that allowed my unit to ship with a defective mini-plug cable.\n\nAnd speaking of cables, the vendor threw in a mini-plug to 2 RCA plug adapter cable that is not included in the Sony package. Just a nice little extra so there are enough provided audio cables to cover any setup your TV might have.\n\nEDIT: Ended up having to return this to Amazon. It worked fine for 2 days and then went DOA again. I disconnected and reconnected everything and, again, it worked OK. Next day, DOA again. The problem has to be in the power supply or the audio cable to the TV, but I didn't feel like having to do more troubleshooting. Packed it up (glad I saved the box and packing) and sent it back to Amazon for a refund.",
        "Good sound. Good battery life. Easy to get in the charger. Easy connection; just hit the auto connect button and they hook up.",
        "The headphones were extremely easy to set up. They do a great job of being able to enjoy TV without having the TV turned up too loud for others. The biggest complaint is that while watching a show, there is a momentary drop in sound. Sometimes it goes days without the issue and then some days it might drop 4 or 5 times during a show. Just simply turning my head seems to resolve the problem so not sure if it is a signal problem or a malfuction. Other than that, I really enjoy the ability to watch a show and be able to hear it without it being too loud for my wife. I haven't gotten used to the location of the volume button to adjust the volume without having to take the headphones off but I'm sure I will get used to thatl.",

        "- Sound with music sources is generally pretty good, especially for the price point. Very clear left-right separation, good bass, and overall decent quality. A little muddy at times particularly in the mid-range, but generally pleasant.\n- Sound with voice sources is more than sufficient.\n- Sound with games is also more than sufficient, again due to go left right separation, decent bass, and enough clarity across the frequency range that normal gaming sounds are clear and identifiable.\n- Microphone has gotten generally low marks from people on phone calls and online meetings - its been described as muffled and sounding like I'm down a long hallway from the other person.\n- Bluetooth - lost a star here, specifically for the lack of being able to put it in pairing mode if its already talking to another device. In general pairing was quick. It does need to be disconnected from one source in my experience before it will connect with another (i.e. I had to force-disconnect it from my laptop before I could search for and connect it to my phone). There appears to be no way from the headset it self to force it into paring mode if it is actively paired with a device. Bluetooth range actually seemed better than my go-to's from a sound perspective - I could be a couple of rooms away from the source and still hear clearly (sometimes my galaxy buds will drop the connection from the same location).\n- Fit and finish is reasonable for the price point - buttons are clearly labeled have a solid click to them. The power / play buttton isn't completely flush with the outside shell of the headphone, but not a big deal. They are a little stiff right out of the box and they are on-the-ear, so a little more pressure on the ears initially. I expect they will wear in over time.\n- Overall these seem like a really good value option - not highly recommended if your main use is for voice, but otherwise a good pair of relatively inexpensive bluetooth headphones suitable for sound in gaming as well as watching videos / listening to audio.\n\nFWIW My go to's generally are Bose QC30's (almost 10 years old) and Galaxy Buds II for reference, so I'm reviewing this based on the price point, not as a comparison to my main headsets.",
        "My son recently told me that he was being bullied on the bus ride home. That seriously triggered me because some kids... they're just mean. So I've been strategizing on how to keep my son busy on the Middle School bus ride and one of our ideas was to get him headphones so he could just ignore the kids and hopefully, they'll leave him alone. I ordered these headphones for just that purpose. Came in great, sturdy packaging (really nice quality on the materials). The headphones fit him perfectly (12yo boy, plays football - not small). The ear pieces fold in for storage and snap into place easily. It charged overnight and he was able to use it for a full week (to/from school) without having to recharge it. The ride to school is about 20 mins each way. Connected with no issues with his iPhone SE. Has helped so far with the idiots that are bullying him on the bus - will update if the headphones break. So far, so good. Great quality for the price. Even if he gets a few months out of them and they get crushed, I would buy again.",
        "I liked some things about these headsets, primarly that they are small and light to wear. If you have blue tooth connection to a phone or a TV, it isn't difficult to connect. However, be aware if you have paired to a phone and then try something else and your phone is in range, it won't drop the phone and go to the new item. Unpair the phone then you can pair to your TV or other blue tooth device.\n\nThe sound is fine, but if you are an audio expert this won't be the headset for you. If you want a low cost, unit for yourself or a child, it should be adequate.\n\nInstructions: There are some language issues in the instructions as it was obviously a translation. The printed instructions are very very small type and are somewhat skimpy. With some testing and trying I was able to get some things to work as expected when connected to my TV, but it was not easy to figure out for each different connection I tried.\n\nI found that the micro data card is probably not going to be useful for most users as it uses, not a regular micro SD card, but a micro TF card of only 16 gigs. Apparently a TF card is NOT as SD card. I don't have a TF card so I couldn't test it, but it will physcially accept an SD card, but not read it. Therefore unless you have TF cards of 16 gigs or less, that item is of no value.\n\nMost mobile phones no longer have a direct audio plug, but I found that my husband's Samsung S10 does have one and music will play from that phone to the headset. The track changing did not work, nor the volume using the wired connection.\n\nI found to make the volume work you must hold the track/volume (+or _) button down. Then the volume on my Samsung TV did work through the headset. It would not work with the S10 through the wired connection, but does work with the bluetooth connection on my S22 phone.\n\nIn summary if you are looking for feature laden, high end sound, you need a different product. This is a nice low cost over the ear for TV watching or listening to sound on your phone."

        "They are comfortable with good sound. I recommend this one.",
        "These are these are the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn, and they are also the first bluetooth pair I've owned--so I don't have much basis for comparison. I like these headphones, and I think I'll get a lot of use out of them, but there are a few problems. The first was the directions, which are not at all clear. (See attached photograph). Fortunately, even for someone who hasn't done this before, it was pretty straightforward to turn on bluetooth on my laptop and my phone and connect the device. The headphones tell you when they are pairing and when they're connected. I think you can only connect to one device at a time. I had to disconnect from my laptop before the headphones would show up as an available device on my phone. For me, that's no problem because I will probably only use them with my laptop.\n\nThe sound quality when listening to YouTube videos on my laptop was good. I was happy with it. It was equally good when listening to a video on my phone. However, the sound when making a call is a bit muddy, for both caller and callee. I could easily understand what my interlocutor was saying (and he could understand me), but the sound quality wasn't clear.\n\nConcerning the range, I could continue listening up to about 40 feet away if there were no walls between me and my laptop, but when I was in the next room, the sound cut out about 20 feet away. If there were two walls (even with open doors) between me and the laptop, I could not get a connection.\n\nFinally, a word about the controls. They are located on the back of the right headphone. I had to take off the headphones to use them, but I suppose when I'm used to it, I'll be able to use the controls by touch alone. Concerning the features of the device, it was easy to figure out how to pause and how to move from one track to the next (I did this using a YouTube play list). Also, if you are listening to a video and you get a phone call, it is pretty easy to switch to the call (just press the center button). However, I could not figure out how to use the FM mode to search for FM stations. I followed the directions provided, but all I succeeded in doing was skipping from one track to the next on the YouTube playlist. I could not figure out how to change from bluetooth mode to FM mode even after I disconnected the device from my phone and laptop.\n\nAnyway, for comfort and sound quality in everything but phone calls, these worked very well, 5/5 but for phone call sound quality and the unclear directions, I'd give them a 3/5. Hence my overall rating is 4/5. However, if, like me, you just want some reasonably priced headphones you can use to listen to music or play videos, you'd be happy with these, especially as they are super comfortable.",
        "Before anything else: these headphones will accept a micro-sd card! I've never seen this feature before - at any price - and sets these apart. Going to the gym or washing our car or anywhere else where you don't want to bring your $1,000 cellphone? Just load up the micro-sd card and you don't need another device. Its like having an ipod built into the headphones, and I didn't see this mentioned in other reviews.\n\nThe headphones are light but not cheap feeling - they weight about the same as a more expensive Phillips pair. The power-sliding button IS cheap feeling but it works without issue. The other buttons aren't remarkable - they don't feel overly cheap nor premium. Call quality is good enough.\n\nThey are very comfortable on your ears and the padding is surprisingly soft - both the foam filling and the faux leather covers (see image 2).\n\nI tested these headphones against 3 other pairs: a $10 pair from Monoprice (center); a $100+ pair from Phillips (right), and my a pair of DT 990 PRO 250ohm from Beyerdynamic.\n\nThey sound much better than, and are much more comfortable than the $10 pair.\nThey are not as comfortable, don't form as good of a \"seal\" around your ears, aren't as noise isolating (with noise canceling off) and don't sound as clear as the $100 pair.\nThe Beyerdynamic's are wired, open-back headphones that need a decently powerful amp to drive them... so these headphones cannot match them.\n\nSo they're better than the $10 pair, and worse than the $100 pair... great review right? They are easily worth $10 more than the cheap pair -- just based on the audio quality and comfort and build quality. I don't really think the $100 pair is worth $80 dollars more than these SLOSAP headphones --- for most people. The SLOSAP's sound good: they are bass-heavy like all headphones in this category, but they sound good. They are clear. They obviously don't have the best fidelity/clarity/response range... but they are $20 headphones and if you aren't familiar with those terms you don't need to worry about it.\n\nThey sound really good. For $20 you cannot go wrong. I've been wearing them daily and will use them when doing things like mowing the lawn or going to the gym or just in the office - where I need something lightweight and comfortable, but don't need the sound to be 100% accurate."

        "Perfect for my work headset. Simple to put together",
        "It\u2019s very durable and secure! It\u2019s a great size for my Beats Solo 3s. Easy to assemble. Love it!",
        "This stand is okay, the tube is aluminum and so you would hope the base would be too, but it's not, it's plastic. I've bumped the stand a couple of times and it falls over easily. I wish the base was aluminum or something else a little heavier or maybe wider. The price is good.",
        "This is a simple holder that does the job! Hold the headphones perfect. Sturdy and well made!",
        "Most headphone stands have some weighting in the bottom to keep them stable while you are placing or removing the headphones. This stand, however, does not. The base is just a very thin and light piece of plastic. It makes the stand top-heavy, and it is impossible to take the headphones off the stand or put them on it without the stand falling over because it is so unstable.\n\nAlso, the base has an ugly logo on it that is not shown in the pictures on the product listing. I was able to mostly remove it using some rubber alcohol and hard scrubbing, but this still left a trace outline of the logo I could not remove. I do not like that it has that logo and they mislead by omitting it from the product images.",
        "This is a very simple, functional and super sleek design for a headphone stand. Always tired of setting my headphones on top of my laptop, on the side of the desk, on the printer, wherever. It takes up less room than it would by just setting your headphones on the desk/table, and it makes the space look much more organized.",
        "I bought this headphone stand thinking it would be heavier and of better quality, but I was wrong. The base is made from a cheap plastic and the stand is really lightweight.\n\nI gave it 3 stars because it does work. For the utility of holding my Sony Headphones, it does work and I cannot complain about a product that does what is described.\n\nFor the price, it is a good deal too. You are getting what you pay for it.\n\nOverall, I would recommend if you need a simple headphone stand... but I personally will be looking elsewhere for a sturdier stand with a stronger base and smaller logo.",
        "This holds my headset very nicely. it has a compact base that slots in to a decently small space. It doesn't wobble or tip. It looks modern and sleek."

        "These headphones are comfortable to wear over my hearing aids. The openings are large enough that they don't put pressure on my ears or the aids. The sound is very good for listening to the TV when the rest of the family are sleeping and I need it quiet. Thank you for this great product.",
        "I find these headphones to be very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time, usually about 1 to 2 hours for training in the office. They have a pad on the inside of the head strap that makes them more comfortable to wear than some I have had without the padding, just a plastic strap that irritates eventually. The headphones have a nice charging base that they sit into which also helps keep the headphones stowed and easy to find for the next use. The charging base is also the transmitter that has to be connected to the source device by a headphone jack or a Red/White-RCA jack. I would have given it 5 stars if it was Bluetooth compatible. Another thing to consider is that some newer smart TV's do not have either of these outputs available, my Samsung 60\" TV does not, so I would not be able to use these headphones with my TV if I wanted to. But, that said, it does work good with my computers, laptop and IPad. The headphones come with an understandable instruction book that explains and pictures the connections, operation and troubleshooting very well. Connection and first use were extremely easy and trouble free. Overall I am pleased with the quality and ease of use and comfort of these headphones.",
        "My TV has an optical cable only, this unit only works on rca jacks",
        "Why Did the delivery driver leave my package outside of the post office doorway when it was open for business and a post office customer delivered it the the post office clerk inside !!!! That a lie kevin Davis never signed for package !!!",
        "Good quality head phones. Sound and volume both are quite goid",
        "I really like these headphones. I hooked them up to my computer via RCA to\nheadphone jack cable included and I have to say I love the range. These are not\nBluetooth, they are like the old wireless home phones so the range is way better. I\nam able to go outside on the porch and still listen to my videos playing inside. I also\nlove the look and feel of the headphones themself. They feel well made and I like\nthe way they sit in the charging stand when not in use. I no longer have wires all\nacross my desk.\n\nOne thing about them that is kind of annoying is that they listen for sound coming from\nthe source audio and if they don't hear anything for a while, they shut down. This is to conserve\nbattery life and it's a good thing, but I found it caused them to drop out from time to\ntime when listening to an audiobook or something with no background noise. When\nthe speaker pauses for too long, it thinks there is no audio.\n\nThe only other thing I didn't like about these were the cables that come with them. Basically, they sent the cheapest cables they could find, they didn't\nmake good contact when connecting so there is some signal loss and noise generated from the subpar cables.",
        "Ease of set up. Very comfortable. Recommend",
        "I really enjoy this wireless TV headset. I\u2019ve used it for two weeks now, and can honestly say... it\u2019s pretty good.\n\nThe sound quality is good, but not perfect. I can clearly hear my TV, and there hasn\u2019t been a delay with the sound (when the voices don\u2019t match the actors mouth). The charging stand is made of a light plastic and utilizes RCA cables, and those cables connect to the TV\u2019s RCA ports. The headphones are comfortable enough to wear long term, and I haven\u2019t had a headache from them... yet. The pads are soft and the volume can get loud; there is one single issue they have....\n\nThe volume dial is barely usable. At any higher point than low to medium-low is a constant static. This static is unbearable and ruins the experience. This, which sounds like a huge burden, doesn\u2019t affect my rating. Within 5 minutes I discovered the solution; turn up the TV\u2019s volume and only use the dial on the wireless headphones for slight changes.\n\nPausing a show and returning will turn off the headphones, a kind of sleep mode. This preserves battery life, and all you need to do is remember to turn them back on. I don\u2019t consider this an issue.\n\nMy rating is based on the products ability to deliver an experience that I needed. I work until late, and into the early morning. Going to bed at daybreak means keeping the noise down so I don\u2019t wake anyone up. This headset has allowed me to watch TV again and I\u2019d recommend it for anyone in my situation. I\u2019ll continue using it, flaws aside, because it fulfills a need."

        "Lifelong audiophile. I work in radio, podcasting and music production. Crystal clear sound quality. Almost Bose level. ANC is great too. I can't recommend these enough! If these are in your cart, and you're nervous... don't be. You'll love them. They sound almost identical to Airpods Max or Sony WX5000 or whatever they're called.",
        "The sound quality with these is great the bass is amazing, the noise cancelling works really well for background noise (and that\u2019s coming from an autistic adult with sensory issues) they are pretty comfy and they don\u2019t fall off my head or squeeze too hard, the controls were a little confusing at first bc the instructions aren\u2019t clear but just look up a video on YouTube to help you and it works great. My only complaint is that every once and a while the sound will cut out for like half a second, I can\u2019t figure out why it\u2019s not often enough to bother me too much but it is kinda annoying. Please let me know if there\u2019s any way I can fix this. Other than that great headphones for the price",
        "These bargain headphones go way past my expectations. I bought them for traveling as an alternative to earbuds that get uncomfortable on long flights. The sound is way better than I expected and they are light and comfortable. However, the noise cancelation is astounding. I'm in my own world. On two flights, the attendant had to flag me to put up the seat and window shade for landing. I didn't hear a thing. This was in and out of Europe where people are polite. So I'm sure they were trying for some time without being disruptive. So funny to me, it's worth making this review.\n\nBargain brands like this really deliver.",
        "So what are the differences between the SE and non SE Sonoflow? Only thing I can tell is that LDAC is not a feature in the SE and some minor cosmetic changes. ANC seems the same, which puts it in-between Soundcore Q35 and Soundcore Space in effectiveness, overall slightly above average for this price point. Great buy at under $50.",
        "They are near perfect, the mic isn\u2019t great and it lacks a 3.5mm jack but personally I didn\u2019t care about that. This headset overall though for music and content in general are 1000% better than expected, these sound better than my computer headphones pushing 32bit audio, they sound cleaner and more crisp, the battery life is next level. I don\u2019t use them every day but I just charged them for the first time last week, that\u2019s over a month and a half without a charge. Good work 1more top notch.",
        "They have the best sound out of any headphone or bud for me. The only complaint I have is my outer ears get sore. And they are not sweet proof. If those things were correct you wouldn\u2019t be able to buy a better set. You can\u2019t sound wise. And I say that having a set of Bose the sound and bass quality is 0 to none. I listen to them 5-8 hours a day every day. Until I start to sweat \ud83d\ude13. But the are truly a awesome set. And we\u2019ll worth the money bar none",
        "I am not a audiophile but graduating in 69, most of what I listen to is Rock! I.listen to a little Josh Groban, Enya, etc. Anyway you will not be disappointed with phones. Its a promise.",

        "I love everything about these headphones, especially the color but mostly the sound. I listen to a lot of dubstep and other heavy bass music and these are not only comfy for long periods but sound great, 9 out of 10. 9 because they feel sort of flimsy and could break if I'm careless. I have Bluetooth earbuds that sound great too, but I don't like using them all the time like I do these.",
        "Very thicc earpads, but can feel pain for prolonged use probably since this is my first on ear. Weird build quality as there are 5 different plastic finishing but don't feel cheap. Decent sound.",
        "They sound as great as you might expect from Skull Candy earphones. I find on-ear headphones to be more comfortable than over ear headphones. So, I think these are comfortable. The midrange is scooped giving a pleasing bass and treble response. They're kind of flimsy though and the cord is only 4 ft long.",
        "For the price these are excellent headphones and a worthy candidate for \"daily driver.\" For me, these are computer/desk headphones. That is my use and that is probably how you should plan on using them as well. The cushions are very soft but the fit itself is on the firm side. Because the cushions are soft, they are nice and comfortable. Because the cushions are soft I'd be hesitant about getting too much sweat in them at the gym. They won't fall off-- that's not the issue-- but I'm guessing you don't want to get the cushions wet. Are they durable? They sit at my desk. I thought about stuffing them in a \"getting too full\" backpack for a flight recently and I declined to do so. If you are really going to be putting them into very full bags maybe see if you can handle a pair in the store before making a decision. On the desk? As long as you aren't yanking these things off you should be fine.\n\nSound review? This is hard because there is so much that goes into it. I'll give it a shot. I can't talk about leakage because I'm not usually around people when these are on. There is no noise cancelling but the fit and the pads do an okay job of getting rid of a lot of background noise. These replaced some Koss Porta-Pros and some old Sol headphones as my main laptop headphones. (That's where I do most of my work.) So yes, I'm running off a laptop. No fancy power sources. They can get nice and loud and not bring in any distortion. That's good. I guess these are probably \"somewhat warm\" sounding headphones. I listen to some vaporwave and a lot of metal (black/thrash and such) so I think I cover the need to hear all levels and ranges of sound and don't have a need to focus on one aspect over the other but I guess the elephant in the room is always bass? It handles bass pretty well. It isn't an overly aggressive bass sound but you can hear it nicely and distinctly. There is some punch to the bass but, to be sure, it isn't at the level of beats headphones (and I like beats, but they are also a lot more money). Listening to some of the raw metal recordings, the bass is nice and it handles the distortion and rawness of metal tracks very well. So, the bass is good to the extent that the headphones generally maintain a consistent and clear sound-profile. And there is clearly more bass than more clear or neutral sounding headphones. It isn't necessarily a bass heavy headphone but it is definitely bass capable. I can make the volume louder or softer without introducing any more distortion and I don't have to listen to it loudly to \"hear\" the music.\n\nThese are very good headphones for the price. The four stars is because the headphone market is brutal and these are four star headphones, especially for the price. They are not magic value headphones that you would/could pay +$150 for, or something like that. That is, in my mind, going in to five star territory. For the price you will probably pay for these on this site, you are getting a really great pair of daily drivers and they are easy to recommend. I'm considering getting the (a) blue-tooth version of these.",
        "Also nice that they can connect to your phone to play music.\n\nJokes aside, for the price point it is hard to beat the comfort, sound quality, and battery life here. I see a lot of people complaining about the \u201cplastic-y\u201d feeling but these are not $200+ headphones, and if you are expecting headphones that have better build then you are in the wrong price bracket. I will also mention these are the second set I owned. The previous model I had for 3+ years. These look and feel just about the same but with better battery. The durability is just fine",
        "as per usual, skullcandy never disappoints. i've sworn by the jib series of earbuds for years and these headphones are just as high-quality as the in-ears. much like the jib headphones, they're nice with the high-end but a little on the heavier side with low end. that's not at all a minus for me. reminds me of the \"mega bass\" sony had for a while. the low end is not offensive at all but rather pleasant and fairly transparent.\nthe cherry-on-top with these phones is the power they can handle. again, much like the jib earbuds, these phones can handle pretty much as much juice as your device is able to throw at it with no distortion. a phone won't crank too much but i also tested them with a headphone amplifier and they blast!\nthese headphones don't have any noise-cancelling system but i generally avoid that anyway. they're also not very quiet externally so if you're blasting music, everyone around you will hear it, too. that may be a con for some but i only use these at home so no biggie.\nthe only drawback for me is that they're a little smaller than i expected (hand in the pic for scale reference), but that's not at all a design flaw and not anything to bring it down from five stars.\nthese headphones are great not just for the price but ESPECIALLY for the price. they perform every bit as well as anything you'd find in the $50-$100 range. if you're looking for something for studio use, these are not for you as they're made to sound good, not flat. but if you want to rattle your brain with clear, defined boomy sound, these are the ones!",
        "I like the sound quality for audio recording and listening. Unfortunately, you get what you pay for - and the headband is flimsy and easily cracks and breaks. I won't be buying these again.",
        "Very practical. They are nice when I don't want to hear noise around me. Quality is good. They can connect to 2 devices at once which is pretty cool. Super quick and easy to go back and forth between my computer and phone.",
        "Gran sonido totalmente original",

        "",
        "I was reluctant to buy these due to a lot of reviews saying that the plastic headband is prone to breaking. I figured I'd give them a try anyways, and if they broke, well, then those people were right. Turns out that's not the case though!\n\nI have been using these for 14 months now, DAILY, because I work from home, and they are still looking and working like brand new. I take them off and put them on easily 20-30 times a day. Sure, I've been gentle with them when taking them off/putting them on and hanging them on my desk, but I think everybody should take some care when doing that anyways.\n\nPros:\n- Ear pads are SUPER soft and cushiony (also a con, read below).\n- Sound quality is DECENT for such a cheap pair of headphones. I'm a bit of an audiophile and will often return headphones if they don't sound good (and trust me, a lot in this price range and even more expensive don't sound great). Sure they don't sound as good as my $300 headphones, but for normal/everyday use while working, they're good enough.\n- They look fantastic.\n- The inline mic is decent (I'm able to have conference calls with it no problem and people hear me fine).\n\nCons:\n- The ear pads are a bit TOO soft and compress a lot, causing some discomfort during longer listening sessions, probably due to the plastic behind them. Maybe they got worse with time, too.\n- They *feel* flimsy (BUT they haven't shown any signs of weakness or breakage yet).\n\nI'd definitely buy them again.",

        "These earbuds not only provide great sound, they are actually comfortable. My ears don't hurt after wearing them for an hour or two. I had never heard of them before but decided to give it a try and I'm a very happy customer.",
        "not very comfortable ,maybe I just need to get used to them. great sound for my talking books though. good price.",
        "I use these to listen to TV and also my iPod when I walk each day. I previously had three sets of Sony earphones similar to these. The Sonys were $30 each and within 1-2 years I would have to replace them because one of the wires would break internally. Joysico seems to be a better product in my opinion....and WOW! less than half the price of Sony. I've only used the Joysicos for two days now......",
        "I bought these for a painting job. I get into all different kinds of positions and these stay put on my head and firmly in my ears. The sound cannot compare to over the ear headphones but they are ideal for this kind of job. They are very good at blocking out the sound of the sanders I am using.",
        "I needed a set of plug in head phones for my riding lessons and clinics. Most earbuds would not stay in my ears and I would end up having to stop to adjust them. After reading reviews from runners that use these, I bought them. These stay in place throughout my riding lesson without having to make any adjustments. Very pleased with this purchase.",
        "At first I didn't think I'd like the way the headset hooks over the ear going from the front to the back; however, it works nicely and I don't notice any difference. If you look closely at the photos of this headset, you will see that the ear piece is attached to a small arm-like thing.

        "These Belkin bluetooth headphones are *fantastic* for the price (under $30). Amazon shows a number of critical reviews dragging down the review score for these based on pairing/connectivity issues, but like many older bluetooth devices, this can be very device-dependent with newer phones/tablets being more reliable.\n\nI'm glad I gave these a shot since I personally had no issues pairing the Belkin headphones with my Google Pixel 6. I paired them once and now the Belkin headphones connect immediately when turned on and disconnect immediately when turned off. I have multiple other bluetooth headphones and speakers paired with my phone, and they each connect perfectly to my phone when turned on (although I never turn on more than one headphone/speaker at the same time).\n\nThese Belkin headphones fit great on my 6 year old daughter at the smallest setting. The headband has plenty of adjustment to the point where they could even stretch to fit my adult head, so they should continue to fit her well for years to come. One thing to note is that if you have larger teens, the thinner plastic in the headband becomes unsheathed when extended and I could see that being less durable. But at the smallest setting, these feel pretty sturdy, especially in light of how affordable they are.\n\nSound quality and battery life are both more than acceptable for the price point and intended use for kids. My daughter thinks they are clear sounding and told me several times she appreciates how she can better hear the words in her favorite songs. She uses the headphones mostly for longer car rides, so I haven't been able to confirm whether it achieves the quoted battery life, but it is plenty long enough for our needs.\n\nLast thing to note: I suspect that the listening protection/maximum volume of 85 dB is for bluetooth only. I wanted to buy a bluetooth headphone that also can connect via wired since my daughter can use it when playing our keyboard/digital piano. However, when plugged in to our keyboard at full volume, these Belkin headphones get noticeably louder than they do over bluetooth. So if you're going to have your kids use these wired, consider supervising or monitoring the volume to avoid hearing damage!",
        "Bought these for traveling by with my 18month old. So far we have used them several times. Sound quality is pretty good for the price, they are lightweight and comfortable. Connectivity is good, easy to pair. Not sure about battery life as we have only used them for a few minutes at a time but they feel sturdy even though they are not heavy. I am very pleased with these as travel headphones for my girl so far.",
        "My kod is 1.5yrs old and this fits great at the smallest setting. Being his first headphones we didn't want to drop $100 on a pair. The $20 JLabs looked like it would be too big so we opted for these Belkins. The sound quality is as expected for the price range. When maxed out it didn't seem as loud as standard headphones. I could barely hear them at listening volume when they were sitting on the coffee table.\n\nOn the first go, the tike kept them on for over 5 minutes. Whether it was the allure of Vivo or not, it was comfortable enough to not be bothered. He has since gotten more used to it. Hopefully, 2 months is long enough for him to enjoy having them on or else that 5hr flight is gonna be rough...\n\nPairing them is very simple. I do not like how you cannot enter a pairing mode with a long press. Regardless of device, it needs to be unpaired before you can pair it to another device.\n\nCan't speak on the battery life too much since the kid hasn't used it enough to warrant a recharge. That being said, he's used it for at least 1 hr - longer if you include standby mode.",
        "These headphones deliver good sound quality, pack a flexible microphone, provide protection from high volume levels, can be both wired-or-Bluetooth, and if that's not enough, they have a 3.5mm out for sharing. I bought this for a child but at this price point, I could try these for myself! Excellent design at a good price point.",
        "Good wireless headphones that fit both my 3 and 5 year old. I took them on multiple airplane trips and they lasted the whole flight without needing a charge. They're durable and work well but I do not believe they're noise cancelling. I didn't buy them for noise cancelling though so it wasn't something I was bothered by.",
        "I bought these for my kids to take to school with them. They have lasted the full school year with no issues at all. They are also a great price point and comfortable.",
        "My daughter loves listening to music and this headset was always present every time we travel! It connects with the Bluetooth quickly, and the sound is great! She said it\u2019s pretty lightweight and fits her bag\u2019s front pocket too when folded. She rarely charge it and would always keep the charge for long hours!",
        "Comfortable on the ear and made of good material. Looks good so far. Also connects easily via bluetooth.",
        "best headphones for kids. i got one before but unfortunately my kid break that. but he love this soo much that i bought the same one again.",
        "Fit kids head well. Sound is clear and battery life is sufficient.",
        "So I am a fully grown adult with the ear canal size of a small child. I have searched high and low for tips that fit because literally every other earphone I've tried would fall out, and I came across these and bought them because they had tiny size earbuds so I gave it a shot. The xxs fit perfectly in my ears (embarrassing) so I'm really really happy about that. HOWEVER... the mic sucks. I bought these pretty much solely for talking on the phone and apparently I sound muffled and as if I'm underwater. Sound quality on my end is great, music sounds great and clear, touch controls are easy. But if you are buying these to talk on the phone, don't bother. Only music? Get it. Need tiny tips? Absolutely, but find another brand of earphones to use the tips on. 3 stars for sound quality on my end and tiny tips.",
        "Got for my kid for Christmas, one earbud totally stopped working last week. Save your money, time and the aggravation of a kid who is upset and frustrated, especially after they worked hard at making sure they took care of their belongings only to have the company fail them. Belkin - please do better. People work hard for their money.",
        "Build feels pretty flimsy for fifty bucks. I assumed it would be USB-C but it's the older mini usb, which sucks. Sound quality is not terrible but again, for the price I expected better."

        "This is a review of the Skullcandy Crusher Evo Over-Ear Wireless Headphones.\n\nI listen to music and audiobooks a lot so I am always eager to try out new headphones. I am happy to say that I really like these a lot.\n\nOn the plus side, these come well-packaged with good, easy-to-follow instructions. It\u2019s very easy to pair with my Kindle and my tablet and cell phones. They are also easy to store in a protective zippered case and they charge up quickly with different charging cables. They hold a charge for a long time.\n\nWhat makes these extra-nice is the sound quality - it is rich and immersive. I often have an issue with the quality of the bass but not with these; there is a simple sliding bass adjuster with which you can control the bass but even pulled all the way down they sounded great. I have attached some photos which show you the sliding adjuster and know it\u2019s easy to reach all the controls with your hands while the headphones are on.\n\nThe only critique I have is that I found the headphones to be a little uncomfortable if worn for any length of time. My husband did not have this issue with these and he has declared that these headphones are for him.\n\nRecommended with the one issue above.",
        "I haven't gotten to use these much but the little time I have I am in love with them. Most buy them for the ability to increase the bass but for me it was the opposite! I had a pair years ago that you could adjust the bass on and they helped tremendously with the headaches I get from the bass, so far since I can turn the bass all the way down on the earphone it is helping too. They connected easily to my laptop the first time and every time I have used them. As I said I have the bass turned all the way down so I cannot comment on that but otherwise the sound quality is great!",
        "The Crushers are a meme. They have been for years and I did try the originals and they were pretty terrible. I saw these pop up and decided to give them a shot.\n\nThe Bluetooth connection seems great and I've had zero dropouts but there is also a pretty hefty amount of latency, definitely more than enough to ruin lip sync. The wired connection is much better, but I am also plugging it into a ~$20k audio chain so it's kind of being carried by that but even being wired at all totally eliminates the latency so it's a win in my books.\n\nIsolation is actually quite poor for a closed back. It really doesn't block out much outside noise at all, but it's not that bad when actually listening to things and conversely, it leaks a LOT of noise to the people around you like a semi-open set.\n\nComfort is honestly great, but I do wish that there was more space inside the cups, my ears basically touch the pads all the way around.\n\nThe sound quality overall is about average, and tuning is fairly neutral with what seems to be a bit of rolled off treble so detail does suffer quite a bit, but using the AutoEQ (everyone has free access to EQ whether it be on PC or mobile and if you own these and aren't using it, you wasted your money) preset for the Crusher Evo does make them DRASTICALLY more capable. The haptic bass is hilarious. It's fun, but it is also basically pointless above around 10% of the slider, any more than that and it just exclusively takes away from all performance and sound quality. Is it funny to crank it to max and listen to bassy tracks or action movies? Yes. Does it sound good or add anything positive? Absolutely not. That being said, the tactile feel of having it around 5-10% is actually pretty cool and I do like it.\n\nIn stock form without EQ and with the Bluetooth latency taken into consideration, these are a firm 3 star. With EQ and hard wired, I'd put them closer to 4 stars. Price wise, these are a $100 headphone and the listing I got them from had them at a $199.99 price and is now at $179.99 and at that price, these are a total joke and in no way worth that asking price. They aren't worth a single cent over $100 and in my opinion should be closer to $75 solely because of the fairly unique haptic bass. If Skullcandy could tone down the haptic bass to a more usable range and cap out around 15% of the total but retain the whole sweep for finer adjustment and get the stock tuning in line with something closer to Harman (again, EQ is free and can accomplish this), these would be a great buy at $100 for someone wanting something fun and engaging. The Bluetooth latency is probably a thing of the past seeing as that these are a few years old and Bluetooth codecs nowadays are much better so the newer models most likely don't suffer from this nearly as much, but I can't say for sure. Overall decent product just a bit overpriced and needs some help to perform where they should.",
        "The sound quality is great with everything coming through clearly, the bass was fantastic. One thing that effects the sound quality is the positioning of the headphones because they do not fully envelope the ears and may press on and block some of the ears. This also effects the noise canceling a little. Because they are on ear a little they can get a little uncomfortable over time but expect this will vary depending on the person and the size of their head and ears. As with any headphones the controls take a little getting used to and these are the same. Don't have a good idea about the battery life yet, will update when I do. Really like the looks and build of these.",
        "In my experience Skullcandy always delivers. This headset is easy to use, easy to take with you and the case keeps is safe when you\u2019re not using it. It has good battery life and charges fast. I love that you can easily control the bass level. These aren\u2019t as awesome at noise cancelation as my AirPod Max headphones, and they don\u2019t have quite the same sound quality, but I don\u2019t like to travel with those, because they are so expensive. These Skullcandy headphones are affordable, have great sound and travel well. They are also great for keeping in your bag, so you always have a pair of headphones with you.",
        "Still not better than AirPods, but given its price and branding for skull candy, it\u2019s a pretty mid range basic headset that could last you a while. Probably the best for vacations if you don\u2019t want to worry about losing expensive or valuable items",
        "Exactly as described I love the sound quality it comes with everything you need"

        "I love my Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro but there are times where my ears need a break from them for comfort. I wanted corded headphones specifically beacause of not wanting to lose tethering and to have natural sound. The Sonys are amazing and has better sound dynamics than the Bud2 Pro. I know I'm comparing apples and oranges. I was going to return them based on the coil cord and using them primarily with my phone, but I changed my mind and will keep them. Why? For the pricing and quality you can't go wrong with these especially the sound quality!!",
        "These are NOT noise cancelling, so don't make that mistake. They do, however, have great sound quality and are quite comfortable. I love using them for video calls at work because it's actually better when you can hear your own voice a little (I gather that's why podcasters seem to all use these exact headphones). I also love how long the chord is.",
        "Sony has always been my go-to for top notch technology. These headphones continues the legacy of quality Sony products.",
        "Youll be tempted to check that your loudspeakers are off. Delivers a full bodied sonic experience. like a thatre sound system. Movies will seem to be alive. Concerts will deliver every instrument to your ears Stereo imaging is perfect.",
        "Worth the price! Of course Sony always is. I love these.\n1. The spiral cord never gets tangled,\n2. Super great sound,\n3. Comfortable....these have it all.\nI could have saved a lot of money I wasted on other head phones which were made of inferior plastic, and broke apart in a couple of months.",
        "Super headphones! This pair of Sony MDR-7506 Headphones has extra long \"curly cords\". I wish they were straight cords, which would not tangle with my other cables, and weigh so heavily on the headphones as to pull them off my head. All else, the comfort, and the frequency response, not boosted in the bass and not rolled-off for the C-8 on a piano, makes them ideal for Studio work. With equally well performing mikes, they combine perfectly for piano vocals, so that the vocalist knows that others hearing a audition or studio recording will not hear breathing, or false bass, but what the singer hears in the Studio room acoustics. Excellent headphones. My second pair. My first pair, I clipped-off the curly cords and put on a Gold-plated stereo connector. Cheers!",
        "2nd pair of these. Tried another wireless pair as a cheaper alternate to these, only to return to these. I prefer the wired option given there are so many other BT devices that want to pair with BT headphones.\n\nGreat sound. Comfortable around the ears. But this pair develops a pressure point on the top of the head after an hour of use. Maybe it's a break in thing. Lots of length adjustment for the ear pieces themselves. That mitigates the issue, but only slightly.",
        "2nd pair I've owned. First pair lasted several years with heavy use, I work with these.",

        "It's lighter than my last headphone and more fitting.",
        "I LIVE in noise-canceling headphones. I don't enjoy hearing people yell from room to room or have belching contests or get mad at the news. Headphones are perfect and don't cramp anyone's style or life. So my last (pricey) pair had been taped together so many times it was time for new ones. I started to get the 3rd set of the kind I'd had for years (about $250), because they're great, but I took a chance on a cheaper pair. I didn't hear the garage door opener, twice, in the room right over it. I didn't hear anyone yelling for my attention 4 feet away. And the sound quality is excellent. I can't believe how much better these work for 20% of the cost!",

        "La caja hermosa. Honestamente al abrirlo se ven muy pl\u00e1sticos y simples. Aunque eso es bueno ya que son ultra ligeros y por fin mis orejas se mueven adentro. Sella bien y deja un espacio lo cual no suda. Si sientes que le falta potencia y sonido al ser USB recomiendo el FX EQ una app para todo que sube la calidad de cualquier audifono. EL LDAC no funciona en IPHONE O WINDOWS 11.... recomiendo conectar a USB C con un cable para obtener los 32 bits 96hz de amazon hd o tidal y mejora el microfono. Curiosamente en Bluetooth b\u00e1sico con un ecualizador que suba potencia es mejor que con cables, OJO SONIDO audi\u00f3filo y le falta potencia si eres basshead no creo, es m\u00e1s para viajeros de aeropuerto, cami\u00f3n o el metro . Su fuerte es lo ligero y la bateria que presume de 36 horas con ANC que cancela un 50% ruido no hace milagros. LA CANCELACI\u00d3N DE RUIDO ES SUTIL no es su mejor caracter\u00edstica pero el sello que hace y su ligereza es lo mejor adem\u00e1s del LDAC en ANDROID es supremo por la calidad que parece con cable... El modo ambiente suena mejor, si lo registras ganas un modo. Dos toques MODO JUEGO con poca latencia o LAG para juegos exactos o pel\u00edculas... Los uso con un Motorola con DOLBY ATMOS y mejora. Modo ambiente filtra con su microfono algo del audio afuera por si requer\u00eds oir algo y no aislarte, un boton y te asila ANC con la m\u00fasica sin hacer milagros ojo NO ES UN TAP\u00d3N . Perfecto para el aeropuerto o oir a alguien que te grita. Si activas el ANC cancelaci\u00f3n si genera una onda SUTIL Y LIGERA no esperen milagro BOSE... pero suficiente para el METRO O UN CAMI\u00d3N O UN VENCINO RUIDOSO INCLUSO PARA EN SILENCIO MEDITAR SIEMPRE Y CUANDO HAYA SILENCIO ACABA CON EL RUIDO DEL VIENTO DIGAMOS Y COCHES LIGEROS CAMINANDO, EL MICROFONO ES REGULAR Y CONECTADO EN USB MEJORA MUCHO... ES COMO PONERTE TAPONES DE GOMA BARATOS Y SELLAR LOS OIDOS... no es la gran cosa su ANC. Vale mucho por su pila, por la distancia literal traspasa muros, por el LDAC en android pero en windows 11 no se puede sigo investigando como sacar el LDAC en IPHONE, ahi no recomiendo s\u00f3lo ANDROID. Gran producto. ligero, suficiente CALIDAD AUDIOFILA LIGERA, y lo compre a 15 meses donde pagar\u00e9 menos de 5 d\u00f3lares al mes por muchos meses... as\u00ed si lo vale... si quieren BASS vayan a un CRUSHER o incluso gamers o un CHIFI KZ si quieren ruido loco y potencia incluso sony mejora BASS en sus TWS... este es un audiofilo ligero rendidor de pila y movilidad mas que potencia de pl\u00e1stico... recuerden EQUALIZAR un FX APP recomiendo o les faltara potencia al principio.",

        "I\u2019ve thought I\u2019ve broken these so many times, I shove em In my bag, I\u2019ve dropped them, I\u2019ve sat on them-they haven\u2019t broken. Beyond that they still sound as good as they did when I bought them sometime in 2022. I use these in the gym, at work, at school and the noise cancellation alone is great. I will say it\u2019s not completely noise cancelling when there is no music but honestly as a woman I greatly appreciate that, not being able to hear on a walk or run sometimes can be a little dangerous when you are used to somewhat relying on hearing the world around you for safety. The battery also lasts really long, I charge these probably once a week and just to put that into perspective for some people I\u2019m in the top 5% of Spotify users, I\u2019m alwaysssssss listening to something with these. The ear pieces rotate and fold in which is nice for when you put them in a bag or something which it does come with a pretty nice pouch, I do with it was a hard shell pouch just for a little more safety but like I said they should\u2019ve broken so many times and they just simply haven\u2019t so I kind of understand. I also think it was cute that it came with a pink charger and aux cord that\u2019s a nice touch Fr. If the bag woulda been pink too??? Ooooo extra extra credit dawg. I really expected these to be okay but they are great especially for the price, these have held up better than a lot of my more expensive headphones in the past. The ear pads are also very comfortable not too soft but also not too hard and the music is louuuud like with these I can listen on 1/3 the volume I would on earbuds. I will say half volume or more the odds of innocent bystanders hearing your music is decently high. Anyways love these 10/10 recommend",
        "I bought these about a year ago, and they work really well. Comfortable, good sound, long battery life, easy to use. But about a month ago part of the plastic on the headband broke, so when I'm wearing them, they don't stay in place very well. Even though I had no paperwork, figuring that most electronic items have a one year warranty, I contacted the seller and told them the problem. I included a copy of the invoice, and the replied very quickly that the warranty was still valid, and all they needed was my name and address and they could send me a replacement. I thought I would have to send the broken one back, but no. Less then two weeks later I received the replacement, and it works just like it's supposed to. So I'm very happy with both the headphones and the company.",
        "I've been using these headphones for six weeks and my verdict is in: they're excellent. They really get the job done at a surprisingly low price. I bought them because my gym was driving me nuts. They blast the music way too loud, and while 99% of the people working out are wearing their own headphones. Why do they do it? I HAVE NO IDEA.\n\nI listen to Audible novels in the gym. I can't stand ear buds, and my trusty old lightweight on-the-ear headphones let way too much noise in, even when I'd crank the volume all the way up, which made me worry about hearing damage. So I decided to try over-the-ear buckets with noise cancellation. I was skeptical that this model would be decent at such a low price, but I was wrong. Here's what I discovered:\n\nComfort: very comfortable. Even after 90 minutes I have no trace of head or ear fatigue. They're just plain comfy. And they're snug enough that they do not shift at all during my workouts.\n\nSound quality: I'm no expert but it seems perfect for music and audio books.\n\nNoise cancellation: WOW! I'd never tried noise cancellation before and it's amazing. Put them on and click the noise cancellation button and suddenly it feels like a dome of silence was lowered around you. I kept turning off the button and partially removing the headphones just to verify the difference and wow, very cool. Almost all of the cacophony of the gym is greatly diminished -- all of the machines, banging weights, treadmills and everything seem to disappear. Same on an airplane. Same at my doctor's office waiting room when I sat next to some kind of noisy dehumidifier -- I pressed the button and the noise from the machine literally disappeared. Blew my mind.\n\nThe only problem and why I give it 4.5 stars instead of 5: In the gym, most of the background noise goes away, and same with the blasting music bass sounds and instruments, all gone -- however, the music VOCALS are still there. But they are reduced a decent amount. I'd say reduced from a 10 to a 5, whereas the other noises are reduced to a 2 or 1 or even zero. So I can still hear the vocals, but it's not distracting and my audio book is easily heard.\n\nSo given all that, this is a great product that I'd buy again. Very impressive!\n\nUPDATE: after writing this review I wondered why the noise cancelling was not very effective with vocals. So I googled some articles and learned that even the most expensive noise cancelling headphones do not do well with reducing human speech, because it is at a frequency that is too high, whereas current noise cancelling technology is most effective at lower frequencies. Bottom line: it's a weakness with all models of noise cancelling headphones!",
        "I\u2019ve used these for maybe 5 months now and throughout my first semester of college. The battery lasts like 3-5 days sometimes more and that\u2019s counting walking all around campus, using them in the gym, studying, etc. They are very noise cancelling especially with the AMC filter. Not too bulky but also big enough because I don\u2019t like small headphones. They\u2019re super cute and honestly amazing for only $50. Way better than spending 200+ on beats or AirPod maxes. They can feel a little tight sometimes when you wear them for too long but it\u2019s never really been an issue for me. And I can use them when talking on the phone and people can hear me well. Definitely recommend.",
        "Ordered this for a 14 hour drive at the start of the year and it is still extremely high quality and functioning. Don\u2019t gota waist $100 of dollars on name brand really good noise canceling and buttons make it easy to adjust the audio"

It also has a very long, extendable wire, which is very convenient when wanting to be far or moving around. Overall, these headphones are very good, as it has both enhanced sound and comfort.",
        "The description is a bit misleading. None of the modern TVs support a 3.5 mm AUX jack. Yes, the seven-meter cable is a very positive aspect, but unfortunately, it's impossible to connect these headphones to any modern TV. That's why I gave the product four stars instead of five. Everything else is quite decent. Everything shown in the pictures and description matches reality. The stand and the 6.35 mm adapter are included. The sound quality is relatively good for this price range. The seven-meter cable is an addition to the headphone's main cable, so it doesn't cause inconvenience if you're close to the jack. You can simply disconnect it. One more thing to note, if you truly want to connect these headphones to your TV, you'll need to purchase an additional converter that will convert the optical audio output found in almost all TVs into an analog signal. This will require extra spending."

        "This just works! I have been using this for a solid week now & felt compelled to leave a review.\n*Fit is great, the velcro makes the headpiece 100% adjustable to your needs.\n*Bluetooth pairing syncs automatically with my iPhone, no fenageling needed!\n*Simply timer options - push the + button three times and you get an audio message telling you the setting you have selected\n*Battery life is great - I have used it 4 nights in a row without any additional charges\n*The speakers are completely removable and adjustable! This makes for easy peasy cleaning, and the adjustment is as simple as using your finger to move around the round speaker so that it is perfectly situated on your ear, or wherever you like.\n*The speakers do not in any way hurt my head or ear, and I sleep on my sides.\n*The volume is perfect for me, I listen to sleep hypnosis podcasts at night. I do not want or need anything to be noise canceling while I sleep, I need to have some awareness if a boogeyman is in the kitchen at 3 a.m. doing my dishes loudly.\n*If you turn it on but don't use it for 5 minutes it shuts itself off, to save the battery life.\nI only have one con and it doesn't bother me in the slightest, but I see where it could be annoying to someone's sleeping partner. The blinking LED light when you are using it is really bright and invasive, especially if you are sleeping near someone else's face.\nOverall Fantastic purchase especially for the price, I would recommend :)",

I've had earbuds that sound awful compared to this.\n\n- The fit is good and you can adjust with the velcro strap\n\n-The speakers are very comfortable whether I sleep on my back or side. I canot feel the speakers at all though the padding.\n\n- The volume is great, and the quality of sound is surprising!\n\n- The battery so far is really good; I've used it for a few nights in a row and it's still at 80% charge.\n\n- Bluetooth pairing was instantaneous\n\nI am super pleased with this purchase.

Plus, the headphones are adjustable, so you can position them in the perfect spot for your ears.\nThe Bluetooth connection is easy to set up and maintain, and it works well with any Bluetooth-enabled device. You can play music, podcasts, or even white noise to help you fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer. Plus, because the headphones are built-in, you won't have to worry about tangled cords or uncomfortable earbuds.\nAnother great feature of this sleep mask is its portability. It comes with a handy carrying case, so you can take it with you wherever you go. Whether you're traveling, camping, or just staying at a friend's house, you can easily bring your sleep mask and headphones with you for a better night's sleep.\nOverall, the Bluetooth Sleep Mask with Headphones by LC-dolida is an excellent product for anyone who wants to improve their sleep quality. The comfortable, breathable design, adjustable headphones, and Bluetooth connectivity make it a must-have for anyone who struggles with falling asleep or staying asleep.",
        "The mask was bought with the intention to listen to some soothing recordings from my Fire Kindle while falling a sleep. It did the job. The mask sat on my nose comfortably and blocked almost all the light apart of one little imperfection of the side of my nose.\n\nI do however have notes to add: Should the mask have a timer on it to turn off after a set time, that would have been superb. The speakers can be heard by others in the room. Should they be earbuds although wired that would be more convenient and private.\n\nOn a lighter note, If I may make a suggestion and be rewarded with shares for its sale. The mask could have vivid coloured lights inside and in front of the eyes, which are electronically synchronised with the sound. Of course they will have to be controllable, on and off. They can then be used with light meditation and Yoga. An app on the phone or tablet could be designed and programmed to enable functions for the mask. I say this with a satisfied smile of a happy customer."

        "I was skeptical but quickly found that these headphones provide excellent sound and are very comfortable on the ears. This is the way we listened to music back in the 1980\u2019s and I encourage you younger folks to give wired earphones a try. The provide excellent sound and are way more comfortable to wear. Those in ear earphones get uncomfortable after wearing them for awhile and they only last about 4 to 6 hours, wired earphones never need a recharge you just want to make sure your phone is fully charged. Theses are excellent headphones and I promise you will come to love the outstanding sound they provide.",

        "For $50 I expected decent headphones and was excited that they came with the cord to use with iPhone 13. I was disappointed in the sound quality and realized I have to constantly jiggle the cord to get any sound, if I hold it just right I get the bass otherwise no bass. I have $6 headphones that are better quality.",

        "I previously purchased the iPhone Headphone Jack adapters which would work for a while and then stop working. The first two I bought were not apple brand but the third one was and none of them lasted. I saw these headphones with the iPhone cord and purchased them on January 17, 2022. I use them for walking/running. This week around June 1, 2022 the sound began to come from only one earpiece and when I jiggled the cord around it I could tell that it was because of the cord that the wires inside had probably become compromised. It did come with two cords and I will have to dig out the other cord which can connect to my computer speakers and use them with the audio jack at home, so I will give them 3 stars because the headphones work well but the cord is a problem.",

HOWEVER ( yes there is a \u201cHOWEVER\u201d in this review ) once you listen to music/podcast/reallyanything, for a while ( and I mean a WHILE ) ya start going deaf.. pretty soon you have the volume up all the way and it sounds like a whisper when really you want peace listening to music\u2026 I\u2019m now certified deaf and need hearing aids.. is that from old age and NOT the headphones? Probably..?..\n\nThis review is for goofy purposes in which would make people laugh only, I mean NO offense to the company or people who have actually gone deaf due to headphones ( or any real reason)\n\nno I\u2019m not actually deaf and I\u2019m not old\u2026\n\ud83e\udd2a\u270c\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25",

Overall great product and looks more expensive than it is. Highly recommend if you\u2019re not looking to spend hundreds of $s on headphones but still want slick design and good every day quality.",
        "I ordered these Power Locus headphones due to the fact that I ordered my wife a set of Power Locus Headphones and they are great. These are not! The ear muff size is sized for children not adults. My wife's version has adult size ear muffs. The padding in these are minimal and are uncomfortable to wear. The padding in my wife's version has 3 times the padding and are much bigger in size. The pictures for this product show these as the same size as the version I bought for my wife and with the same amount of padding. They are advertised as over the ear which they do not cover over the ear of an adult and \"PREMIUM OVER THE EAR COMFORT\". There is very little padding in these and the ear muff size is much smaller compared to the set my wife has. I am very disappointed in these and are returning them.

Apart from that I am very happy with them and take them to the gym brilliant\nEasy to connect to your phone and you can also plug in to your laptop or PC, that was the main reason I got them. But I did not know they would be so big and bulky so I do not travel with them to work unless I do not have much to carry coz they take up space in your bag.\nBut has said they are really good for the price and I am happy coz sound and cancellation is brilliant these are deal breakers for me"

        "I like to sleep while flying. I like to relax waiting for my appointments. This allows me to listen to my tunes at my leisure. It doesn\u2019t hurt your ears. I can comfortably sleep on my side without compromising the sound quality. Let\u2019s not forget how fashionable it looks. I got the butterfly pattern. It is definitely worth the price. I am mostly likely order another one so if it needs to be cleaned, I don\u2019t have to wait to enjoy it.",
        "I've been using this headband for about a week. My experience has been mostly positive.\n\nReading the reviews, I expected the earpieces to be a little uncomfortable when laying down. While I can certainly feel them, they are very round with no pokey edges, and the fabric is comfortable, so paired with a soft pillow, I have no trouble sleeping on my side. The ear pieces are in a long pocket. if you wear the headband as it comes, the ear pieces will likely be too far back for you. This is good, I think, since it allows for different people to adjust the location of the pieces to their liking. With a little finagling, you can get the speakers in place to your liking. If you really don't want them to shift as you wear them (which has not been a bother for me) you could get out your sewing kit and add a couple stitches behind the speaker, or around it as you like.\nI will say that sleeping on my back is a little annoying, as the seam hits me at the nape of the neck. This will probably be more annoying for persons with shorter hair, but even people with longer hair like me may not find this too comfortable. I get by with a little adjusting.\nI don't find the front control to be uncomfortable in any way, but you can feel it being there, so be mindful of that.\nThe material is very soft, and is thin. I find it very comfortable. It does ride up a bit on my head with wear, even when I'm not sleeping. I find myself adjusting it back down to my ears every so often. This doesn't bother me, but it's worth noting. because it rides up, it makes my hair look really dumb. I am not likely to wear this in front of anyone I want to impress for this reason, and because of the front control panel. It is very comfortable as an eye mask when I sleep.\nIt falls off as I sleep in it overnight. This is not an issue for me as I only use it to go to sleep, not to stay asleep. It is easy for me to find in the morning, unlike the bluetooth corded ear buds I used to use, which I have lost.\nI use this headband to listen to 20 minute stories as I go to sleep, which helps me ignore my snoring roommate. I used to have trouble falling asleep to snoring, but while I can still technically hear the snoring, I have had no such trouble since trying this product.\nIt charges pretty fast. I was very surprised on the first charge when it seemed to fill up in a matter of minutes. I wonder if it was pre-charged when it arrived. I have not drained the battery much, since then and I charge it every day. I don't use the audio feature all night long. I only use these headphones for 20 minute stories to go to sleep to, and sometimes to listen to Youtube videos while my roommate sleeps, which is sometimes an hour or two. The battery life has never gone as low as halfway, and usually not very low at all.\nThe speakers seem to work perfectly for my needs. I'm not audiophile, but I seem to hear my videos as clearly as any other headphones or through my phone's native speaker, which is all I ask.\nThis was the perfect solution for me.",
        "I bought these to use while walking or at the gym. I have now added wearing them to the laundromat while washing clothes. I have also slept with them. I even wore them to Walmart to do grocery shopping.\n\nComfort - They are very comfortable.\nNoise Cancellation - They are not noise cancelling but I want to be able to hear what is going on around me so that was a good thing. Five stars on this feature simply because it did not cancel the noise and that is what I was looking for. Five stars because I did not want noise cancelling and I got what I wanted.\nSound quality - For what I use them for the sound was fine. I listen to audiobooks/podcasts and stream movies so my only requirement is that the voices are clear. Five stars on this feature because again it worked for me.\nVolume Control - The control buttons are good. There are 3 buttons and they protrude a bit. If I need to power them on and off I just feel for the center button and long press it. The up and down buttons are on either side of the power button. It is easy for me to find them by feel.\nBattery - While I was using them only 2 or 3 hours a day the battery lasted multiple days before charging them. I now charge them daily due to using them to sleep (see my notes for sleep below).\nSleeping - The only thing I want to note is, if you intend to use them for sleep, make sure to keep them charged daily. The reason for this is there is a loud voice the proclaims \"LOW BATTERY\" and it is LOUD. Even when the speaker volume is low the voice is LOUD. Charging them every morning will prevent this from being a problem. A full charge lasts all night.\nMovement - While walking around or biking I do not find that they move around much. The headband stays in place. Sometimes the speakers will shift a bit but it is just a matter of reaching up and sliding the speaker back into place. There is no need to adjust the entire band. Now sleeping is a different matter. They usually do not stay in place at night. I usually wake up in the morning with them either completely off or just around my forehead (think 80s aerobics videos). This is fine for me. I mostly use them to help me fall asleep. Also, I am a restless sleeper. I toss and turn A LOT. They may stay in place better for someone who moves around less.\nCleaning - Cleaning is easy. I do sweat a good bit when walking so they get sweaty. I remove the electronics and put them in the washer (cold water) and let them air dry. It can be a bit time consuming to put the electronics back in but it is not too bad.\nDurability - I have owned this pair for over a year. I bought them June 2022 and this review is being written August 2023. In this time I have noticed no change in their function. I am, in fact, planning to buy a second pair for rotation while one pair is in laundry.\n\nOverall rating of four stars. Deducted one star for the awkward \"LOW BATTERY\" notification. They are listed as \"sleep\" in the description but that voice could wake up light sleepers.",
        "This is a weird review, but hopefully it can help someone as it has me. This is a great product and works for all the expected uses. But, when I had a recent asthma exacerbation and I just could NOT sleep when hearing myself wheeze, this device helped. Earplugs help when someone ELSE was making sleeping noises, snoring, etc, but only amplified my own breathing noises. Everytime I hear myself wheeze, I feel the need to reposition or cough so\u2026no sleep for me. I tried regular earbuds but they aren\u2019t comfortable or practical for a full night sleep. THEN, I tried this earbud headband. Very comfortable. I found a thunder/rainstorm sleep track on YouTube with noises that are similar to wheezes and rhonchi\u2026and suddenly I lost my own breathing noises in the background noise. First good nights sleep in weeks\u2026As I continue to get past this current illness this headband will remain my go to!",

Battery life has been superb so far, used them in the gym for 4 days in a row doing my hikes (1 hour long, as well as walking to and from the gym, so about 1 1/2 hours) when I first got them, and the battery life had only dropped to 90%.

        "I have purchased so many versions of headphones over the past two years and have been so disappointed, some started well and then didn\u2019t work after a while or hold a charge. Some were uncomfortable. Some had static, Some were dumb and if you went to do something like adjust volume it they would hang up on the person you were talking to\u2026 so I went into this purchase with the thought that they would last for a bit and then I\u2019d be done. I love them!!! I can\u2019t believe how affordable they were, they are comfortable, the sound is phenomenal. The quality and build of the product is long lasting plus the nice little storage case helps! Connecting to devices was simple and now they connect whenever I use them. Other devices I had to pair and impair to get to work,.. these know they are paired!!",
        "These are amazing. Solid sound, great connectivity, super cute, and the price is hard to beat. In love with these headphones.",
        "These headphones are pretty good for their price! They lasted me about a year and are pretty sturdy. They feel comfortable on your ears but the noise-cancelling is not that great. Additionally, the sound quality is decent but hollow at times. However, this is a really good steal and battery life lasts me about 4-5 days when using them about 2 hrs a day.",
        "I purchased these about six months ago for my fifteen year old daughter. This is the first accessory she has had this long without damage. She takes then everywhere. She loves that they still work with a cord if the battery dies. I love that they fold because she had snapped several others I've purchased. They have a case as well, nice feature.\nShe loves the sound and the charge time is remarkable.\nVery pleased with these and the price tag.",
        "I purchased these for long haul flights - earbuds will give me a headache with extended use. These worked very well. It doesn't use the battery to plug them in (no need to even turn them on). I like that you can plug them in, as well as pair with a different device (like your phone). Worked perfectly for my flight.",
        "They work pretty good and sound quality seems pretty good. The only thing I dislike is there is an odd noise when no music is playing. It's pretty quiet but I notice it and it's annoying. I won't return them though because otherwise they work good and were very affordable.",
        "So I've been using these headphones for over a month now, and what I did notice about it is that with bluetooth audio is delayed, but with the jack cord it is not, now i don't mind it when it comes to music, because i'm not worried about the timing of it. Overall i really like them, comfortable fit, good sound quality, long lasting battery life, high bass. (which i like in my music) So give this one a try to see if it exceeds your expectations. Have a wonderful day :)",
        "They work well, quality hearing too. Purple always a plus.",
        "I've had these since last November (2022), and they're almost a year old at this point. They're still going strong, sound's really good and the battery life is pretty good as well. No complaints here and when I ordered them last year, the shipping was pretty good, semi-fast and I've been using them since.\n\nI listen to a lot of music and game a lot, and these headphones haven't disappointed. Noise cancellation isn't the BEST but, that's the only mild complaint I have.",
        "F\u00e1ciles de usar y conectar. La calidad del sonido es buena; el volumen m\u00ednimo ya es m\u00e1s que suficiente, no he probado el resto pero es que ya me basta. Solo llevo una carga de bater\u00eda y me parece incre\u00edble lo que est\u00e1 durando. Adem\u00e1s lo de que tengan radio es un punto extra que nunca est\u00e1 de menos. La \u00fanica pega que podr\u00eda sacar es el sonido que hacen cuando est\u00e1n conectados y no se reproduce nada, pero ya ves t\u00fa que problema. Ahora que duren.

        "I needed headphones for working and watching videos on my laptop in the evenings. So as not to disturb the family with sounds. Quite decent headphones for their price. Pairing is instant, the connection is stable. The headphones are lightweight, absorb external noise well. They support a second pairing with the phone, and are easy to switch. The presence of the case is very nice. The power button is good. The function switch buttons are very inconvenient. But the connection in the nodes for folding the headphones seems fragile. That's why I use them at home and try not to fold them often. Delivery is fast and free. This is not so important, but the packaging was missing the branded black box.",

        "I just got these, so this is just an initial review for now. If anything changes, I will update after some use.\n\nI am pretty \"behind the times\" on most technology, so these are my first bluetooth headphones/ear buds despite the fact that none of my devices have been compatable with corded headphones for a long time - if I'm in a place where I can't play audio directly out of the device, I usually just don't. All of this to give context that I am not necessarily hugely picky about the small details - I just need something that would let me listen to music or movies when I fly. I wasn't sure what to expect from the price, but so far I really like them!\n\nPros:\n- Clear sound quality! I read lots of reviews that the bass was a little much, but I don't think it's bad. There is a button on the left ear that you can use to change the sound settings, so if the default setting isn't good for you, see if one of the other 5 settings works better!\n- Easy set up\n- Stays put on your head. I put these on and did a quick yoga flow with a few down dogs and it barely budged. If you need these for some kind of physical activity, it seems like they aren't going to be needing constant readjustment.\n- Decently noise canceling. While you can still hear a bit of what is going on around you, these seem to do a decent job of limiting extraneous sound. And they do a great job of containing the media sound withing the headphone - I put them in my lap and played music and couldn't hear it! No need to worry about bothering someone next to you.\n- Easy to adjust length\n-Decently comfortable. I tend to have pretty sensitive ears when it comes to headphones/earbuds, so not immediately feeling like my ears are being smashed is important to me. I will update after I have had an opportunity to wear them for a long time (1+ hour) but I've had them on for about 30 minutes and still feel comfortable with them on which is a good sign.\n\nCons:\n- The plastic exterior just felt a bit low quality to me at first. When I pulled them out of the box I wasn't sure how well they would work because they just felt kind of cheap. They're really pretty though, and lightweight, so I don't really think this is a big deal, especially given the price!!\n- The joints where the ear pieces can fold in to compact just feel a bit stiff, and I am a little concerned about how many times I'll be able to fold/unfold them before something breaks. For now there aren't any issues, but I'm keeping my eye on it.\n- It's kind of tricky to control the volume on the actual headset. I have sensitive hearing so I have only been using the lowest possible volume setting and it is plenty, but if I need to toggle up or down it's definitely easier to do on my device. The press and hold system on the ear piece doesn't allow for as much control in the margin of increase/decrease in volume. Not a huge issue, but an area that could use improvement for sure.",
        "I've been looking for a good pair of wireless headphones on a budget price ever since Apple decided to remove the 3.5mm jack from their phones, with every phone company following suit. So now I'm forced to listen to wireless products. However, the cool thing about these headphones is it CAN be wired, which I love.\n\nThe sound quality is amazing for the price. It blows my wireless earbuds out of the water in terms out sound, from vocal clarity to bass to every little sound that goes into the song. They can get quite loud and powerful. The noise cancelation also seems to work quite well.\n\nI've been wearing these pretty much non-stop since they arrived. They're pretty light but also decently durable for the price, so you really can't tell you've got them on. The battery life is amazing I can wear them for ages without charging, I think I've only charged them once in the past few days since they arrived.\n\nAnother really cool feature is the buttons on side, power on/off, volume up/down, some sort of EQ mode button that allows you to switch between different pre-sets to make specific music you're listening to feel deeper, and you start to notice more sounds.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there's probably way better wireless headphones in the market, but for this price (I paid $19.28) they are absolutely amazing and I might pick up a few more pairs in case one ever breaks for some reason.\n\nIf you're reading this review and still hesitating snagging a pair of these and they're in the $20ish range. Snag 'em up. They're fantastic and I'm very pleased with the quality, comfort, and durability of these wireless headphones for the price.\n\nSide notes: It also has an FM feature which I haven't tested much, but that's unique and cool. Useful if you enjoy listening to certain radio shows. The microphone for phone calls seems to be quality, and of course I can hear the calls crystal clear.\n\nI'm sure I'm missing a few things, but overall I'd rate these a 10/10 based off all the factors I listed above. Give them a try you won't be disappointed!\n\nP.S. I LOVE the gold and black color. It looks incredible. Buy these. They're awesome. You're welcome, now go enjoy some tunes.",
        "I bought these last April 2022. They recently broke because I took them off my head at a weird angle and so they broke. Even though they broke it still functions. Prior to that I had dropped them plenty of times over the year I had them and they did not break. So, they're durable. I was able to tape it together but I'll need to get a new one regardless because it doesn't fit on my head the same. The sound quality is good for headphones that are $20. However, the mic quality is absolute shit, so make sure you have an external microphone you can use. The volume controls are decent but I typically set my volumes using my PC settings. I've used them for work from home, meetings, and even for playing games. The battery life is good too and they work while plugged in and charging. I also like that they'll automatically shut off when not in use. Overall, definitely good for the price. I'd recommend it.",
        "OMG I CANT SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THESE!! THEY ARE LOUD, NOISE CANCELLING, THEY CONNECT QUICKLY AND THE BATTERY LIFE IS CRAZY!! I WILL BE BUYING MORE OF THESE!! THEY ARE JUST AS GOOD AS BEATS!! GREAT FOR WORKING OUT, LISTENING TO AUDIO BOOKS AND PODCAST. GET SOME!!! THEY CHARGE FAST, C TYPE CHARGER AND THEY COME WITH A 3MM JACK FOR PLUGGING DIRECTLY INTO YOUR PHONE IF YOU NEED TO. JUST THE PERFECT PAIR AND AFFORDABLE.",
        "I really like these headphones. They are light, wireless, and easy to use. You can pause your music, adjust volume and skip via the headset itself. Very good buy if your looking for a headset to use when doing chores and stuff."

        "These are nice headphones if you want something a bit more noise cancelling and something you can take on the go. It is good headphones for a budget. These are great to travel with. Compared to many other wireless headphone, these are over the ear headphones. The headphone does have a microphone built in. It does come with both Bluetooth and aux connection if you want to do it that way. That being said they can work for laptop, tablets, desktops, and phones given they have Bluetooth capability or 3.5 headphone jack. The headphones are fairly decent size. They are not extremely heavy so it is great to walk with. There is a simple bag carrying case with a pull string to close the bag. You can control the sound and such on the actual device or your phone. There are LED light indicators to show charging as well. From what I can tell, you can use an aux port even with the device's battery is dead. It utilizes a PU leather and foam for the ear cushions. With this material, you can expect the material as some irritation to your skin if you sweat. For best cleaning, I would just wipe it down with a damp towel or an alcohol wipe. It is a simple press button. It does utilize type c charging which is nice. I do not think it can connect it wired to use the headphone The type c cable provided is pretty long. The headphone fits nicely and comfort. It does take a few uses to break in the leather material and be comfortable putting these headphones on. Like a pair of shoes, you have got to break the headphones in for they are easier to fit on your head. The head piece can also be adjusted on the ends. One thing to note about this is that it does get warm to wear this during hot days. It can rub against your skin if you happen to sweat. It can cause irritation. It does not pinch too much on my ears so it will not crush my ear into my glasses which is nice. It uses the USB cable charging purposes. The sound quality is really good as well I am able to use this headphones with my VR headset and the sound is amazing. It feels like I am sitting in the room as it has surround sound. All controls for these headphones on the left side. You can mute/unmute. The microphone definitely picks up my voice very easily and clearly. It blocks out a good amount of surrounding noise for something without a wind guard. The device is also very easy to adjust in my opinion to make it definitely feel very comfortable. The black and red color is nice. I would say if you can just to wipe it down with those lint catchers to get rid of hair and just wipes with an alcohol after use. It is very easily fitting to any head with the adjustment. There is no dongle so you need to connect this via bluetooth or you can use aux cable. Overall these are inexpensive headphones that are good quality for the budget. The sound is good and it has the basic features many other headphones of this size haven. It does make gaming on your phone an experience though which is great. I do like that you can use both aux and bluetooth.",

        "We wanted wireless headphones for our travel needs. This headphone does the job very well. Not the best-sounding ones as high-end headphones but good enough at this price point. Overall it has a good capability & we (My wife & I) are satisfied with it for the price factor. I would recommend it.\n\nMy 2 cents below:\n\nPros:\n- Sound is good & clear enough. Seals the ear well & noise-canceling features work nicely. I like the bass in these too\n- Microphone works great in office calls & no one has complained yet who listens to me on those calls\n- Comfortable to wear & use these even for long periods of time. The padding is soft & headband/earmuffs are adjustable too\n- 50 hours of playback time is the above market standard for similar headphones\n- The controls on the headphones are easy to get used to it\n- Design is classy & modern looking\n- Build quality is very good overall & feels durable\n- They bundled a carry bag in the package\n- Reasonably priced when compared to the competitive options available\n\nCons:\n- It is not the best-sounding headphones as high-end Sony or Bose etc but it's not fair to compare it with those high-end headphones too",
        "Used these on the plane for a few hours at a time for each connecting flight. They sit comfortably on my large head, due to the soft pads all around and the adjustable length of the ear cups. I was able to use them both wired through the plane\u2019s entertainment system and wirelessly with my iPhone X. Both methods work well and did not vary in sound quality that I could notice. Overall sound quality is decent considering the price bracket these fall into. Yes, there are better but more expensive headphones. But these hit a sweet spot of price, comfort and satisfying sound quality. These ANC8 don\u2019t have too much bass, so some heavy bass songs do distort a bit at high volume. The overall sound quality is fairly good and crisp. Although worth the price, these can\u2019t compete head to head with models that are priced twice as much or more.\n\nThe multi-function buttons work well. They are large and easy to find and control while the headphones are on my head. Power, Volume, Track and Noise Cancellation are all a press away. The Bluetooth pairing to my iPhone X was simple following the included instructions. There are different color LEDs indicating if the headphones are on and/or connected to BT. I like that the volume on these adjusts both on the headphones and on my iPhone at the same time. Some devices have separate adjustment levels which can be annoying. I also like that the battery level / indicator (for the headphones) is displayed on my phone. The noise cancellation works fairly well. Again, it doesn\u2019t stack up to the \u201cknown\u201d expensive units (yes, I\u2019ve tried a few), but these do perform well enough for their price bracket. On the plane they did help me sleep and reduced the annoying loud engine hum, so I\u2019m glad I took these with me. I charged these at my destination only to top them off. But there was no indication of battery shortage during my 9+ hours of use each way.\n\nThese ANC8 headphones came with a rigid black zip-up carry case and two cables. One 62\u201d audio cable and the other 34\u201d micro USB for charging. The included manual is simple, detailed and translated to a few languages. Overall, these are decent Noise Cancelling headphones that are worth the sixty buck$.",
        "Got these as a second pair for workout. Loved the color and design and fits perfectly. The sound is great and makes working out enjoyable. The best part is that I used them after 7 days without charging and they still work. I was convinced it would need charging but I was surprised it worked fine. Totally worth the cost!",
        "Good sound not a lot of bass tbh ear muffs are a little small and the sound canceling doesn\u2019t work",
        "Great product, worth the price.",
        "Decent sound and better quality bass......\nNoise cancellation also superb....",
        "6 weeks into owning these the war cover fell off and cannot be attached"

        "The pliable and supple material wraps around the wearer's head in a gentle manner, resulting in a secure and comfortable fit that lasts throughout the night. It reduces the pain that is caused by standard headphones and earbuds, which may generate pressure points and make it difficult to sleep on one's side. Those individuals who like sleeping on their side while listening to their preferred music or other audio material will find that this headband is a game-changer. These headphones for sleeping deliver an impressively high-quality sound experience overall. The speakers that are built into the headband provide sound that is both clear and well-balanced, which enables me to listen to my preferred music, audiobooks, or podcasts with an amazing level of clarity. The positioning of the speakers has been carefully thought out to match the ears, which will provide the listener with the best possible audio experience without creating any pain or getting in the way. This Bluetooth headband, in addition to having a design that is conducive to restful sleep and music capabilities, also functions as a solution to lessen the disruptions caused by snoring. It helps conceal the sounds of snoring and creates a tranquil sleeping environment for both the user and their spouse by playing calming music or white noise via the headband. My sleep has been substantially less disrupted as a result of snoring thanks to this function, which has been a game-changer for me.",
        "I appreciate the comfortable headband and although I turn it off and on and replay from the band, I mostly control the volume from my telephone. Overall, I love it. One issue I do have is the packaging label. My first box stated it was only for sleep. I reordered a second one and the box stated it was for sleep and sport. I ordered a third one as a gift for a sports coach and when it came the box said it was just for sleep. So which is it? Can it be used for both? How do I make sure I get the one for Sport because that is what I really want it for. It was an Amazon purchase.",
        "These sleep headphones have transformed my bedtime routine. They're ultra-comfortable, with flat speakers embedded in a soft headband, ensuring a peaceful night's sleep. The sound quality is excellent, and the Bluetooth connectivity is convenient. The only minor drawback is they can get warm during extended use. If you enjoy falling asleep to music, these headphones are a game-changer for a restful night's sleep.",
        "Comfortable, soft, headphones have good sound & great volume control. Easy to pair w/ my phone.\nBlocks out sounds & light if I pull them down over my eyes.\nLooks good too.",
        "A headband with great qualities held back by terrible design choices. As we enter into the age of artificial intelligence, part of me feels a really smart robot was given a description of what a good sleep headband should have and made it, but no humans QA tested it.\n\n______\nPROS:\n- Great sound for coin-sized speakers. For years, I used normal-sized headphones to help me sleep. I see some people are complaining about the size and/or shape of these speakers, but my seasoned ears found them acceptable. At least until the technology improves, however it does.\n\n- Easy enough Bluetooth connection. Took me a moment, but I'm not sure if the initial instructions were vague or it was my user error, but now that I know, the headphones readily and easily connect to my smartphone.\n\n- Breathable fabric. I am neither the most or least sweaty person, and my skin feels fine under the headband.\n______\nCONS:\n- Terrible, terrible, terrible volume control. The \"-\" and \"+\" buttons on the headband have two functions: track/playlist navigation by *tapping* either button, and controlling the volume by *holding* either button. All that would need to be done is switch these input functionalities around, so that holding a button switches tracks (after which it waits for you to release and hold again, as you will need a second regardless to hear what track you're on), and tapping it changes volume. A design flaw made much worse by:\n\n- There's a horribly loud and painful beep after you set either the headband or connected device to max volume, and I do mean LOUD. Not loud because everything else it's quiet, it's LOUD. Such a design could only mean that the software in my specific item is horribly bugged, or no one actually tested or cared about this terrible feature in the software (or something else that I hope their software engineer could explain to me). Normally, you shouldn't be listening to headphones at max volume, but if you lose the game of trying to turn up the volume of quiet music by holding down the button and accidentally and unwantingly setting it to max volume, you'll be punished with most unpleasant screech in your ears.\n\n- Flashing lights? At one point, the red and blue lights on front that normally dictate the headband connecting flashed without stopping, lighting up the dark room. I ended up ditching them and using my old, standard-sized, uncomfortable headphones I was looking to replace with this product. After recharging/turning them on-and-off again, the lights stopped. However, the battery was at 80% power when the lights started, so I'm not sure what the issue was.\n_______________\nSMALLER CONS:\n- I see some people have been complaining about the \"Connected\" voice. Specifically for me, it's not been an issue as I connect my headband before I put it on, but I can see why that it a bad design choice if your device turns on or off automatically.\n\n- While the headband is light and small, the buttons have a bad habit of being pressed if you like to sleep on your side/downward. More of an issue with buttons and people in bed, and I wouldn't point to this as a deal-breaker. HOWEVER, considering holding down \"+\" increases volume, expect to be woken up by that loud beep if you lean too far on your left side, or if it falls off your head and you roll onto it as it has with me.\n\n- The positions of the speakers can be adjusted slightly to fit where my ears are. However, the band itself is somewhat awkwardly shaped. There isn't really a position for the band itself to rest on the forehead without the speakers completely missing the ears. So, you have to wear it more on your brow. While I get these could double to cover your eyes, they don't cover my eyes comfortably either. While I wouldn't say they torture you, this will be a headband that you will be aware that you are wearing.\n\n- No noise cancellation. (Didn't buy it for, nor expected it to block noise. Just feels misleading to market it as such.)\n\n_____________\nOverall, I'd rate this three stars. Not three stars of a mediocre product, but a product of laughably bad design that I begrudgingly use for certain good qualities. I will only use this for as long as until I can find a better headband that was actually quality assured, which I hope will be soon. I need some sleep.",
        "I bought this item because I enjoy listening to podcasts before I fall asleep. As a side sleeper, using my AirPods was uncomfortable\u2014they'd press against my eardrum. But these headphones are different. The moment I put them on, I noticed how soft and stretchy the headband felt. It's like a workout headband, but with padded earphones inside. Surprisingly, the audio is loud and crystal clear. Initially, I even thought the sound was still coming from my phone! It was a pleasant surprise. Overall, I'm really pleased with this purchase, especially considering the price. I'd recommend these to anyone interested in a comfortable pair of headphones for sleeping!",
        "This is a neat little gadget. Soft material and covers the head pretty good. The volume isn\u2019t crazy loud but loud enough to not disturb others. I don\u2019t know if I would wear it to sleep but it would be great as earmuffs or if you are a jogger and want to listen to music. Pretty happy with it",
        "Love this, use it when I am walking outside to listen to music. Tried to use overnight but was too hot for me.",
        "UPDATE sept 2023: 4 months later, I'm disappointed. One of the headphones stopped working 2 days ago... Deceiving, I really liked them. I'll find a more eco-friendly with better quality model that will last.\n\nINITIAL REVIEW: I really like this product. The handband is made of breathable material and I really don't feel the earphones even when sleeping on my side. I was worried it wouldn't fit, because my head circumference is small (54cm) but it fits great. It stays in place until i fall asleep, butwhen I wake up it's not on my head anymore, but it is perfect. Easy to connect to my phone and it can also be used for calls. Great purchase.",

        "",
        "I work in a hectic environment. Sometimes it can feel overwhelming. These headphones can help to buffer all the background noise so that I can focus on the person in front of me. I can move the actual headphones within the band, so that they're not actually on my ears which is helpful when I'm buffering sound but need to hear.\n\nI have on a couple of occasions forgotten to turn them off, and they were still playing after work. So I can attest to a play life of 8-9 hours at least on my set lol.\n\nI bought 2pair, and accidentally washed one. It worked for a day or two before it just wouldn't turn on. I was surprised I got that out of it.\n\nI have recommended this product to others, and will continue to do so.",
        "Me encanta usarlo para dormir y poner algo relajante. Es suave, no incomoda el o\u00eddo pues se hunde en la almohada de forma natural y es plano cada aud\u00edfono. La tela es suave. Puede usarse para ejercicio pero no lo recomiendo pues hay que desmontar los cables y lavarlo cada vez lo que no es pr\u00e1ctico.",

        "saw these headphones and ordered the pink ones for me. I had been in the market for some reasonably priced pair and decided to try these. they arrived very fast, 2 days I think, very well packaged and secure.\nthe best part is when I actually tried them, they were so loud and worked so well. they are not flimsy or easily broked. as you see I keep mine on the side of the couch. I have grandbabies that use them and cats that romp on the couch around them and they still work as good as new. I told my daughters how loud they were and well they worked and my youngest had to go work the mud Boggs but didn't want to take her air pods so she took these out there. she came home and said she turned them up not know how well they worked and said she could feel it all through her body. I was ordering her a pair that same night. I just had to order my granddaughter a pair today so it's safe to say we are pleased with the product and how well they hold up. very surprised at the price bc they work 100 as well as the $100+ headphones",
        "I do LIKE,The Problem is that the WiFi Does Not Charge to 100%. But it did come with cords so you can use Either. They Had A Short in the Wires. I Purchased New Cords. I Really like How they Feel When I have Them on. Other than the WiFi issue. Very Good I LIKE.",

        "Superior sound quality with sleek, stylish design. Battery life is very good.",
        "Hands down, these headphones are truly the best, unbelievable sound quality that you can control on the app with sound setting starts between warm to energetic, very comfortable on the ears and long lasting enjoyment and battery",
        "I\u2019m not an audiophile. My AirPods stopped working so I decided I wanted to try on-ear noise canceling headphones with a long battery life. My primary intention is to use them for work calls.\n\nI ordered the Bose QC45, very happy with them (I should also mention I was happy with the sound from my basic AirPods before). Except I couldn\u2019t wear them for longer than an hour because my ears would start profusely sweating??? I googled this and turns out it\u2019s a thing! Some people get hot ears from the synthetic material of the ear cups.\n\nThe main reason I ordered these was because of the leather ear cups. It worked! No more sweaty ears. My ears are bigger than the round part, maybe that\u2019s why, but I still find them very comfortable. Given the \u201clack of seal\u201d I find the ANC to be fine for my needs.\n\nOne thing I find annoying is that to put them back in their case, you have to slide the sides back in. They slide smoothly and aren\u2019t notched. So basically, every time I take them out of the case I have to readjust them when I put them on, and since they\u2019re not notched as you slide the sides out I find myself readjusting a few times.\n\nThe other thing - I was getting frustrated connecting these to my windows work laptop for video calls, but then I remembered there\u2019s an audio jack in the case so now I just use that with no issues. I don\u2019t think they automatically connect to my iPhone like the Bose ones did, but that may be user error. It doesn\u2019t seem like you can easily go between devices like I can with my AirPods from iPhone to MacBook. I didn\u2019t find the app to be intuitive for this either. Hopefully I\u2019ll eventually figure it out.\n\nLastly, I did find that these needed to be broken in - I didn\u2019t know that was a thing, the Bose ones didn\u2019t. Right out of the box, music sounded like it did with my AirPods. I played with the settings, etc. For my needs I didn\u2019t really care, I just wanted my ears to stop sweating. Then one day I was listening to music and the sound was much more impressive.\n\nI ordered the sand color, but in hindsight I wish I had gotten black. The case is light grey for these and I\u2019m concerned about staining over time if I\u2019m not super careful. Subjective, but I think black would probably also look more sophisticated on video calls. Overall I\u2019m very happy with these!",
        "The good: They sound great, very crisp sound without too much bass. They're also pretty comfortable, but if you're moving around, say cleaning your house or something, they will fall off your head. Also, great battery life.\n\nThe bad:\n1. HORRIBLE Bluetooth handling. Once you pair them to two devices, even if you're nowhere near the second device, upon turning them on, expect a few minutes of glitchy audio getting constantly cut, until it becomes okay. The only remedy to this is to factory reset the headphones and not pair them with more than one device. Again, this happens even nowhere near the second device.\n\n2. Iffy touch interface. I still can't reliably skip or pause with the touch interface. Volume is a bit more reliable and has a nice gesture to it.\n\n3. Pretty mediocre to sub par NC. Really unimpressive compared to Sony or Bose.\n\nIn short, I would never buy these knowing what I know now, especially for such a high price.",
        "Recently purchased both the Bang & Olufsen HX headphones and the Bose NC 700 headphones for comparison. My biggest must haves in over the ear headphones are sound quality, call quality and comfort.\n\nCall quality\nThe B&O HX\u2019s call quality is not up to par with Bose. While on a phone call walking outdoors wearing the B&O HX\u2019s, the person on the other end of the call said the background noise was deafening and they could not hear me over the noise (city traffic and wind). I switched to the Bose while on the same call and it was worlds better, lowered background noise, and they could hear me much clearer. Bose won this test!\n\nSound Quality\nThe sound quality of the B&O HX\u2019s was good, however the sound quality depreciates when I switch over to noice canceling. Throughout all modes and different genres of music I noticed the bass is lacking and they focus more on the lyrics and spoken words rather than the music and lyrics. The Bose however blew me out of the water with sound quality, excellent bass, great clarity, and better EQ controls to customize to your liking. Bose wins here as well.\n\nComfort\nThe B&O HX\u2019s are comfortable headphones with amazing build quality. However the earpiece shape is more round than the Bose and did get uncomfortable after about an hour of use. I also found they struggle to stay planted on my head when I\u2019m moving around quickly (not ideal for running or working out). The Bose however have a silicone lining on the upper arm and stay put on my head when running. Bose also won here!\n\nOverall the B&O HX\u2019s are good headphones with excellent features and build quality but at $500 and compared to the Bose NC 700 headphones at $300 I could not justify the higher price tag. I need over the ear headphones to be a device I can use at work to take phone calls and video meetings, at the gym, on an outdoor walk, and on a plane. I feel as though the Bose are the better buy but glad I compared both to find the front runner!",
        "I did truly love these headphones. I'm a fan of the aesthetics and sound. I've tried many headphones, looking for the ones that play music to my ears. I did return these though due to my ears not fitting completely under the ear pad. No discomfort, even after hours of listening but found it to be troublesome with creating a good seal. Another note, there is circular engraving in the ear cups. There are also earcup commands by swiping on them. The engraving can be quite annoying when trying to skip songs due to your finger naturally wanting to follow the engraving.\n\nStill overall great headphones. Can't comment on noise cancelling as it's not really a feature I pay attention to. Isnt the whole point of it to not pay attention? Cant be bad then.",
        "Great sound from these",
        "Design and sound are phenomenal. I was lucky to buy it during promotion.",
        "While it may not be the industry leader in terms of noise cancellation, these headphones performed well in a noisy airplane where I typically use such headphones.\n\nWere they better than Sony WH-1000XM5? Maybe? Maybe not? I understand that \"data doesn't lie\"... but personally, I didn't care much about this - it's not as noticeable to me anyway.\n\nWhat IS noticeable though is a vast difference in the quality of materials and the overall build of these headphones versus the Sony WH-1000XM5 (which I also own).\n\nI suppose one complaint I have is that the touch controls don't work so well for me. Start/stop are completely fine, but next/previous and volume controls are not as responsive. Could be just practice, but must be mentioned.\n\nAll in all, as noise cancelling headphones, they do the job just fine for me. The reason I love these headphones is GREAT sound and the build quality where I can actually tangibly appreciate the premium quality of this piece of equipment.",
        "Calidad premium en materiales y audio. Altamente recomendables.",
        "",
        "Me encantaron son extremadamente c\u00f3modos las almohadillas son de piel real lo que los hacen muy frescos y no sudas, los micr\u00f3fonos son muy claros para llamadas y videoconferencia. El sonido con y sin la cancelaci\u00f3n de ruido es espectacular.\n\nComparados con otros aud\u00edfonos del segmento en el rango de 400 a 500 d\u00f3lares estos son la mejor opci\u00f3n en calidad, desempe\u00f1o, tecnolog\u00eda y dise\u00f1o.\nRevise los sony wh-1000xm5, jabra elite 85h, sennheiser momentum 4, bose quietcomfort 45 y los Bose Noise Canceling 700. Y estos fueron los que m\u00e1s me gustaron, todos los anteriores tienen almohadillas sint\u00e9ticas y a\u00fan que son c\u00f3modos al inicio terminas sudando mucho y despu\u00e9s de un a\u00f1o dependiendo del uso pueden pelarse o descarapel\u00e1rse.",

        "I've had every version of the crusher series and these are the ones I have Benn waiting for. All the previous versions focused way too much on the bass drivers and ignored sound quality and volume output, but the ANC 2's have checked every box this time around.\n\nSound Output - They are so loud! In the past it seemed as if skullcandy was trying to protect our ears for us but not anymore, blast them at your own risk.\n\nSound Quality - The sound quality is great for all genres but to achieve it, you will need to use the in app 5 band EQ. I personally max out the highs and mid-highs, 2 notches of mids above 50% and the rest leveled.\n\nCrusher Bass - No headphones can compete with the bass.\n\nSkull IQ app - Most headphone app seems rushed and not well put together. Skull IQ is polished, easy to use and surprisingly well put together. It also brings more features to the headsets than you thought was necessary.\n\nComfort and Esthetics - These headsets are a full soft-plastic build, so it is very light but still feels robust. Ear cushions are soft and completely covers your ears (could be sweat resistant). Overall look is sleek and classy.\n\nI highly recommend these headphones to anyone besides audiophiles. It is definitely worth the price, only time can tell the durability of these sets but for sure you will want to music/movies more often and even ads are fun to watch.\n\nAs a bonus, I am a DJ, and if you are the type of dj that listens to speaker reviews on YouTube. You can actually hear the different audio quality, especially in the bass.",
        "Was in need of a new set headphones and after doing my searching I came across these online after seeing such positive feedback I was very interested in them. The bass is next level literally feel like there\u2019s subwoofers behind me when I listen to music. The ANC isn\u2019t the best out there but with the bass an a bit of volume you won\u2019t hear anything anyways ( trust me ). The ability to change every buttons actions is so convenient as well great battery life. Fast charging. Great build soft touch plastic and the ear cups are nice and soft. If anyone is in the market for a good set of headphones with bass ( real bass ) these are the ones. Everyone who I let try them out instantly smiles and laughs away because they can\u2019t believe what they were feeling as the bass shakes/vibrates their head. The Skullcandy iQ is great as well and so easy to use. Haven\u2019t had Skullcandy products in a long time so I was kinda anxious trying them out but I\u2019m so happy I did ! They sound great they look great I couldn\u2019t ask for more and the price is also not bad at all. I don\u2019t leave reviews but I just had to",
        "I bought these headphones for the bass, already aware that the noise cancelling would be bad. Its honestly better than i expected but i defenitly wouldn't say its even good. The anc doesnt really work at all. It works better when its off, if that says anything. That said, the bass i defenitly worth the price, and the sound quality is amazing! Defenitly a good purchse, if you can get by the whole \"anc is a waste of money\" thing lmao",
        "I'm a mix between a basshead and an audiophile. I installed car stereos for 15 years so I've heard a lot of different types of setups. I had a pair of Sony XB950BT's that I really liked, but they finally broke, so I needed some replacement cans. I loved the Sony's low end and they didn't sound too bad everywhere else either, so I wanted something comparable. I bought a pair of beats solo3's and was very disappointed with the lack of low end, volume, and overall sound quality. So like any intelligent idiot, I did my research after impulse buying something that didn't fit the bill and came across these ANC 2's. They deliver. I wasn't really sure what the sound quality would be like, but it's way better than I expected. These beat the Sony's in every way, better sound quality, more volume by quite a bit, and bass like a couple of 12's in the trunk with 6-700 watts. It's an impressive amount of bass. The only thing missing is feeling it in your chest when the bassline drops. You'd probably have to spend 2k on a setup in your car to replicate the way these sound as a whole package.\n\nYou do need to tweak them some with the equalizer in the skull IQ app. I've found that turning the the low and the low mid about 3 lines down from the top and then adjusting the bass through the crusher wheel gets you the cleanest sound. If you turn the crusher bass all the way off, it loses a lot below about 40Hz. But adjusted like that with the wheel at about 10 or 20% gets you a nice full sound with some good thump on the bottom end but it doesn't get muddy. That way also keeps it fairly linear through the volume range so you don't have way too much bass at lower levels until you turn it up like some other ways I had tried tuning it before. Some songs don't sound great above that, but some you can go all the way to the max on the crusher wheel and still sound clean. These seem to have the highest pressure levels around 40Hz and drop off a fair amount under 30Hz. You can still hear them down to and below 20Hz though, but not nearly at the pressure levels you do at 40Hz. The mids and highs are way cleaner than I expected and these handle rock and classic rock very well. Like I said before, these aren't audiophile quality, but from being in the sound industry for a lot of years, I got picky about sound quality, but still love more than average low end. These marry the two perfectly if tuned right and I don't have any problem with using these as my daily set.\n\nThey're also very comfortable. They don't clamp too tight on your ears, and the ear cushions go all the way around my ears. No hotspots. I can wear these for hours and be comfortable. The ANC has a hiss when it's on, but I didn't buy these for noise cancelling so I just turn it off. I can't comment on the durability because I just bought them, but if these hold up long term, they're worth every penny and then some if you're like me and want a ton of bass at times, but also want a nice rich/full sounding set of cans when the mood strikes I love that I can change them from one to the other with the roll of the crusher wheel and not have to do anything else.",
        "They\u2019re great, bass u can feel that rumbles ur skull. But tbh I can\u2019t max out the bass slider because of that. It\u2019s almost unbearable bass at max slider uncomfortably. But yeah.. Super long battery life, super soft, good connectivity. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s the clearest sound I\u2019ve ever used in headphones, but that is to be expected in such a bass heavy one and wireless. The noise cancellation is also great. It doesn\u2019t completely silence the surroundings but it dampens it heavily enough that it\u2019s cool to me. There\u2019s a switch that allows the noise \u201cdamper\u201d to turn on or off, to hear ur surroundings better. Pretty neat. Overall, im happy i bought it for sure.",
        "If you love bass, these are for you. They\u2019re comfortable to wear and you can really feel the impact of the bass through your skull. If you were around in the 80s/90s and remember window rattling bass, it\u2019s available with these. The ability to adjust the bass on the fly is nice too! They sound great!",

        "After trying two Bluetooth models that had a disturbing Buzz and returning them I ordered these, they are not Bluetooth! It is some other Technology which they explain. Easy hookup, great sound, very comfortable Headsets. I highly recommend them.",
        "I ordered these since I work on my laptop a lot for sound editing and such.\n\nI'm mainly a bluetooth girl, and they work great for my phone and laptop! It had a 70% charge straight out the box, so I used it right away.\n\nTV-Cable Use: I have a smart TV with Bluetooth capabilities.\n\nThe antenna and cable were very easy and fast to set up with the TV! Nice quality sound and i can even control my TV through my headphones (when using an app w/smart TV.)\n\nNote: (cable and antenna method) Even if you have USB connection on your TV, plug in the antenna to a separate power source. The TV intercepts w/ static if the audio cable AND antenna are plugged into the same place.\n\nTV-Bluetooth function: I'd recommend using the provided antenna and audio cable for TV usage. It might be my TV, but the TV-bluetooth sound got a bit shoddy on this method. Still cordless either way!\n\nUSB-TV audio function: I don't think my TV has this option, so I wasn't able to test that one.\n\nOVERALL: Very pleased with my purchase. In depth instructions, solid packaging. They're extremely comfy, sturdy, and soft! \"All Up In Your Mind\" sounds heavenly in these, so good sound.",
        "This pair of headphones sound great, but not for those who love extremely loud blasting music. How loud they can get depends also on the unit. The cushioning around the phones is great making them very comfortable to wear for hours on end and being it's leather, it's not so likely to soak up sweat when worn in hot areas or for a long period of time.\n\nAlso, this unit has its own audio voice to indicate that the unit is connected and when you reach max or min volume and tells you when it's on or off when you hit the power button. The up/down volume keys are easy to reach as the are next to the power button on the right ear unit.\n\nWARNING: There is a learning curve to setting this up for the first time and the instructions are rather \"touch and go\" and thus, could be better. Though the manual implies the set is specifically for TVs, you can use it on stereo equipment by hooking up the unit with the RCA cable it comes with. YOU NEED NOT HAVE A BLUETOOTH DEVICE TO USE THEM! But you must make the correct settings on your TV or stereo to make them work. Just hope you have time and patience to figure it out when setting them up for the first time or switching units to use them on. This can be a pain if you use it with more than one device and move it back and forth a lot.\n\nIt comes with small signal box with is a bit tiny with a dimly lit signal light up indicator. This box needs to be hooked up to the power cord when listening through the headset. Being the signal box is so small, just be careful to put it in a table top place where it won't get bumped or fall behind the shelf or table by accident, or you can easily lose it.\n\nMake sure when not in use that the recharging cable is plugged into the headset. Once you power that up, switch the recharging cable back to the signal box so it is getting power.\n\nDespite its tininess and lack of ability to hook it up to multiple devices. I still like it and if you don't mind doing a little tinkering, you will too.",
        "Great sound and easy hook up.",
        "I bought one Rosida Wireless Headphones for TV in April, bought a second one in July for another room & TV. Both crapped out last month. After charging these units are suppose to re pair to base unit at TV. They did not! After following the instructions many times I called Amazon to get contact phone number for Rosida. Tried to call everyday for 2 weeks, always got busy signal. Then I called super early, got through but the number was for a Publishing company. Complete waste of my time. Amazon did give me a partial refund, since I was beyond the 3 month return window. I told Amazon this product was junk and why are they selling it. I suggest finding another brand of headphone and I will not buy electronics from Amazon again. Things they sell should last more than 8 months.",
        "The headphones work great and are very easy to set up. Took only minutes. I bought them because I like to watch television in bed at night and I was always disturbing someone else sleeping in the next room. Everything is quiet now and I can hear my shows just fine. Very pleased.",

        "I am totally loving this headphone, the color is so vivid and everyone's asking where did I get them.\nNow for the fit is the only negative thing I have to complain about. I have a verry large head, larger than most people, and finding things to fit off the shelf is normally impossible. So they are tight on me putting pressure on my ears squeezing my head. But I can deal with it for the time I use them while I am in dialisys. The battrie life is impeccable I will use them for 3 to 4 hrs 3 days a week and the batrie life will be about 50% when I plug them in over the weekend. Charging time is good too from dead I can get 20 to 25% battrie in just under 20min of charging. I am vigilant about turning off the headphones when not using themas well.\nThe sound quality are close to my older bose headphones I used to have for only about 1 /15% of the cost. As for functions the bluetooth connects easily to phones and pc every time on the first time. As for the FM function I have not been able to get it to work. Which is more of my fault over the headphones at this time. I honestly tried to see if it would work. I was in a building where cellphone have difficulty receiving signals. So I truly did not give it the best shot, but I listen to pand... over the radio most of the time. So I'll try it again some day!!! Impressed with color and sound quality for the price!!!!",
        "I love my pair of headphone and it sound perfect when I hear my music",
        "disappointed... after reading reviews, especially one from an autistic person, i thought the noise canceling was going to be way better. it does decently drowning out noises with audio playing, but that is something regular headphones do anyway.\nbeing autistic myself with sensory overload triggered easiest from sound and a sibling who after learning this intentionally makes noise to spite and trigger you, this not working is terrible for me. i thought i was going to get some peace with these.\n\ni like how it can play while charging, which is exactly what i was hoping for. headphones that can go wired or wireless, and these blue ones are aesthetically pleasing.\n\nthe audio quality sounds like it's coming from a next-door neighbor with thin walls and you're sitting next to said wall. the vocals of a song are ok, but the instrumentals are where it gets most muffled.\ni will say though, that muffled-ness actually makes certain songs i find have too loud of a snare/beat easier to listen to and not causing any potential inner ear pain.\n\nthe headphones themselves aren't super comfortable and hurt on the outer ear not long after wearing them, but it's not unbearable. at least for me, since it's easier to put up with how it physically feels rather than be subjected to the full sounds of things at home.\n\nthese are all my thoughts for now. will update if anything that happens.\n-\nlittle update: got a refund, so i added a star",
        "UPDATE: I received a replacement and tried it out for a few days. Here is my updated review.\n\nPros: Battery life lasts quite a good while, goes over the ears and adjusts well\n- Turns off by itself if left alone long enough to preserve battery life.\n\nCons: When watching a live video it slightly \"pauses\" the audio like a disturbance (lasts for a split second) Sometimes it's like every 5-15 minutes, other times it's back to back (seconds in between).\n- It lacks Bass. You can easily fix this with an app on your phone but I mostly use it for my laptop when studying and the audio feels like it's missing life (best way I could put it) It's okay, it's just annoying to adjust it for music though.\n- Noise cancelation is average, I can still hear people talking when they're next to me, if it had better bass it would've helped a bit.\n\nAll in all, it's an average headset if you're in a budget. At least the replacement works better than the first one.\n\nOld Review: [I bought it to use it for studying and cancel out all distractions. The worst headphone set I've had, the music gets interrupted every 15-30 seconds. It's as if someone paused it then resumed the music for you in a second.\n\nIt lacks bass completely, it sounds like someone is talking to you at a normal volume from a distance so you have to crank up the volume. The noise cancelation is a myth and you can hear everything unless you crank it up.\n\nI asked for a replacement to see if the set I received was defective or not, will update once I receive the new one.]",
        "I'm surprised how well these headphones work given their price. No issues pairing and the bass response is nice. When they arrived, they were super snug because I have a rather large head, but after stretching them out for a day or so they fit nicely. It will be hard for me to spend a lot of money on a pair of headphones now\u2013these work very well for my usage (Zoom/work, CPU, light music/youtube), so no need.",
        "The left earphone broke away from the headband after five months of gentle use. The attachment point where the earpieces attach to the headband are particularly weak. It looks like it could be repaired but I doubt if the manufacturer will provide the part or instructions to do so. I will not buy from this manufacturer, IFECCO, again..",

        "I hadn't heard of this brand before, but I will start looking for their products because these headphones are really great for the price. They are very lightweight and comfortable to wear for long periods around the house. They do a great job of isolating me from the noise and voices when I'm trying to get some relaxing me-time. They're easy to pair and easy to control pandora. Really just an incredible design and quality. Very happy with these great headphones.",
        "I'm no audiophile so I can't speak to the fidelity or acoustics of the Edifiers as compared to others in this class of headphones. But I can say that they sound pretty good to me. Easy pairing with my phone and, bonus, will pair with a second device. This is a feature that I can appreciate, since I often switch between my laptop and phone. Not having to reset the headphones each time I switch is a convenience I can appreciate.\n\nThe fit is comfortable, maybe even plush.\n\nThe noise cancelling is not exceptional, but does cut the background noise slightly.\n\nWhat I do like is the price. Given the quality of design and sound, the price is right.",
        "This is my 3rd pair of Noise Canceling Headphones. I mainly use Noise Canceling Headphones to listen to music (or books) while doing yard work (to cancel out noise of lawnmower & edger). Understand that these are not 100% noise cancelling (none of my three are). You will still hear ambient sound while wearing these (without music). However, music or text can be easily heard \u2013 at a relatively low volume \u2013 even when ambient noise is quite loud.\n\nMy 1st pair of Noise Canceling Headphones is circa 2005 (no Bluetooth AAA battery powered) and has been my favorite \u2013 until now.\n\nINCLUDED ITEMS (pic) are the Headphones, USB-C charging cable, and a bunch of (mostly useless) documents.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS/MANUAL\nFor me, the instructions were pretty confusing. Fortunately, basic operation of these Headphones is fairly intuitive. However, due to the confusing instructions, I feel there are a few features I will not be able to use.\n\nIncluded in one of the other documents is contact info for the company.\nA personal preference: I always prefer direct contact info to the manufacturer/seller.\nI was pleased to see contact info was included with this item.\n\nOPERATION\nPositive aspects\nAs I stated, basic operation is pretty intuitive. I was easily able to pair these Headphones with my music device. I then spent about an hour using all three of my Noise Canceling Headphones \u2013 rotating one after the other \u2013 and comparing them with each other.\n\nOf my three Noise Canceling Headphones, these are the most comfortable. In addition, it took me very little time to operate the controls by feel alone. These are much easier to operate than my other Bluetooth Headphones.\n\nNegative aspects\nThe features associated with the \u201c+\u201d and \u201c\u2013\u201d buttons are pretty straight forward. However, there are six functions associated with the power button. I will have to experiment with these in order to understand how they work. Mainly they have to do with phone-use controls while wearing these Headphones (one I am totally in the dark about).\n\nOf my three Noise Canceling Headphones, these are the only ones that did not come with a protective case.\n\nWHY ONLY 3-STARS?\nI took away one star for each of the following reasons:\no Confusing instructions\no Lack of any storage / protective container",
        "These headphones are ok sound wise. I was a little disappointed because in the listing it says they have their own app for EQ controls and ANC but it\u2019s just 3 preset settings. The ANC works well and the earphones have a good soft ear pads to help with noise but if you\u2019re sensitive to sound these aren\u2019t for you. If you\u2019re looking for something simple these will work but if you\u2019re a big audiophile I\u2019d definitely look for higher quality.",
        "These headphones are comfortable, well padded and suitable for office use. Sound quality is not premium, a bit too much treble and the bass /midrange could be richer, but is more than acceptable for this price point. The noise cancellation works well and combined with the closed back design, it does an excellent job of taming environmental noise. The included instruction sheet provides easy steps to follow for pairing, the diagram provided for device controls is difficult to interpret, however. (noise cancellation is toggled with the button with the bluetooth logo on it)",
        "These headphones arrive well packaged, I found them very easy to connect to my phone.\nThe next step was to download the Edifier app, which is simple but works well enough.\n\nThey're light and very comfortable to wear over an extended period.\nThe controls are easy to use physical buttons, and I'm so pleased they are as I hate touch sensitive panels on similar headphones.\nThey also feel quite sturdy and well made.\n\nThe appearance is quite plain and innocuous, but I like that as they're less of a target for muggers!\n\nThe noise cancelling is pretty good but can't compete with far more expensive models.... this is to be expected though.\nThe noise cancelling performance for the price is very good though and makes train journeys more peaceful.\n\nThe ambient sound setting is very useful when you want to listen to announcements on the train or talk to someone.\n\nThe sound quality is okay but not amazing.\nIt's got the typical v shaped sound profile with emphasised bass and treble.... the mid range suffers because of this.\nSound stage is also quite narrow, but again that's typical of most closed back headphones.\n\nThe app allows 4 different settings for the sound, but i stick to classic as the others make the sound a bit worse to my ears.\n\nBattery life has been very good and charges quickly via USB C.\n\nI would recommend you get a pouch or carry case if you want to keep them in top condition.\n\nFor under \u00a350 these really do offer excellent value for money, they're not the best sounding but they're more than adequate.\nThey would make a fantastic present for a lucky someone.\n\nI hope you find my review helpful.",
        "Sorti de son emballage on trouve le casque, un c\u00e2ble USB-C vers USB-A pour recharger son accu, et un mode d'emploi multilingue assez minimaliste.\n\nLa finition est assez basique mais correcte, ce casque ferm\u00e9 est pliable au niveau des \u00e9couteurs, ce qui limite son encombrement lorsqu'il est inutilis\u00e9, mais il est dommage qu'un sac ne soit pas fourni pour le ranger.\nDes minuscules rep\u00e8res \"R et L\" sont pr\u00e9sents sur le montant int\u00e9rieur des \u00e9couteurs pour indiquer la Droite et la Gauche.

Si on recharge 10 minutes l'accu vide, cela lui suffit pour 8 heures d'autonomie.\nEnsuite il faut appairer en Bluetooth de mani\u00e8re classique, ce casque apparaissant dans la liste des p\u00e9riph\u00e9riques sous le nom de \"EDIFIER WH700NB\". En scannant le QR code sur l'emballage on peut installer l'application \"Edifier Connect\" qui permet de nombreux r\u00e9glages.\n\nCe casque permet de se connecter \u00e0 deux p\u00e9riph\u00e9riques simultan\u00e9ment en Bluetooth, ce qui m'est indispensable puisque j'utilise souvent simultan\u00e9ment un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone et un lecteur HiFi ou MP3. Cependant il fonctionne uniquement en Bluetooth et ne dispose pas d'une prise pour l'utiliser de mani\u00e8re filaire.\n\n\u00c0 l'usage :\n- L'appairage BT se fait sans probl\u00e8me et facilement, m\u00eame pour deux connexions simultan\u00e9es.\n- L'ANC n'est pas tr\u00e8s performant et risque de ne pas satisfaire les amateurs d'isolation face aux bruits ambiants.\n- Au niveau qualit\u00e9 sonore, c'est peut-\u00eatre satisfaisant lorsqu'on ne recherche pas une approche de la HiFi, mais le son est emp\u00e2t\u00e9 et \u00e7a manque d'air, les \"graves\" sont du style bas m\u00e9dium qui s'\u00e9tale et le haut m\u00e9dium et l'aigu manquent de d\u00e9finition et d'amplitude. globalement c'est flatteur si on appr\u00e9cie la vari\u00e9t\u00e9 enrob\u00e9e mais cela ne conviendra pas aux amateurs de son HiFi ou aux amateurs de musique de qualit\u00e9 et travaill\u00e9e.\nCeci-dit il faut relativiser, on en a pour son argent et ces \u00e9couteurs sont \u00e9coutables, ne blessent pas l'oreille et devraient combler nombre d'utilisateurs.\n- Le port du casque est assez confortable et l'arceau se r\u00e8gle facilement pour s'adapter \u00e0 toutes les t\u00eates.\n\nEn conclusion ce casque n'a vraiment rien \u00e0 voir avec la HiFi, il n\"est pas assez neutre et d\u00e9fini \u00e0 mon go\u00fbt, mais il me semble cependant assez correct dans le genre \"flatteur et color\u00e9\" dans cette gamme de prix, son choix d\u00e9pendra de vos besoins et de vos go\u00fbts finalement \u2026",

        "These are the third pair of Edifier headphones I've had and I've been delighted with all of them. The previous ones were in ear so this is the first opportunity I've had to test some larger over ear units and it's interesting to compare.\n\nPros:\n- Excellent sound quality considering the price. You can also modify the balance to better suit your own preferences.\n- Easy to set up and use app giving you additional controls.\n- Build quality feels solid though still lightweight. These aren't going to match \u00a3200+ competitors but are perfectly decent.\n- Easy to set up and to connect, just took a few seconds and the connection remained strong.\n\nCons:\n- Slightly lighter than I might like personally but this purely my preference.\n- Don't fold as much as some other options.\n\nOverall these are an excellent pair of headphones at a very strong price point that I would happily recommend. I've used for music, podcasts and video calls and they were good on all 3, especially the speech based options. If you are looking for headphones primarily for music there may be better options out there but at this price these are excellent all rounders.",

        "I am always on the lookout for a decent bluetooth headset, time for an upgrade it seems.\n\nThe Edifier 700NB headphones are certainly well made, feel good in the hands and comfortable on the head too. In the box you get a manual, warranty card, usb-c cable and the headphones themselves.\n\nConnecting via bluetooth is pretty easy, you get an audible confirmation as well, the headset also has a dual mode, so you can connect two devices and it will remember them as well. It has (beside the bluetooth button), buttons for volume up/down, power and the charging port as well. The quality of the headphones are on par with what I would call a very premium product.\n\nThe Ediifier 700NB even has an android app, although sadly not for windows pcs. speaking of windows, there is a mic too, so you can use it to game/chat with as well. I completely missed it on my first test of the headphones, till i connected it to my pc/laptop.\n\nThe app for android can be downloaded from the play store, if your planning on using it with your phone, then you can tailor the headphones for ambient sound/noise cancellation and music type such as rock/pop/jazz effects. it also has a game mode too all on the app.\n\nWhen paired with a laptop/pc tablet under windows you can still engage \"game mode\" by double tapping the bluetooth button. There is no windows app that I could find in the ms store. which was a shame. But the headphones performed just fine under windows 11, good quality sound. I performed a speaker test on headset, was quite suprised just how well the drivers responded to the shifting frequency changes.\n\nComfortable headphones, partially foldable for stowaway/transport, long run time, easy connect, game mode, adjustable sound settings and a mic too, makes the headset a premium product indeed. Definately a worthy buy."

        "I bought these on prime day for $27.81. I have a price checker and from what I see the are usually around $30-40, which is still cheap.\n\nFirst and foremost, you might be asking why would I buy these. I was looking for iPX7 or iPX8 wireless earbuds so I can listen to music while I shower. The Air Pod Pros are iPX4, which are not good for showering, they cut out every time. The higher the iPX the more water resistant they are.\n\nFor this price I was very skeptical because you get what you pay for. Also, I needed something cheap since I already have Air Pod Pros.\n\nNow let\u2019s compare:\nNote: This is only Day 1 and I will update this review if it doesn\u2019t hold up!\n\nPrice:\n-Golrex $30-40 vs AirPod Pros $200.\n\nWireless distance:\n-Golrex claims 33 feet vs Air Pod Pros claim 50 feet.\n-They both cut out around the same distance. I left my phone in my bedroom, and I went all the way to my back door of my garage, which is on the opposite side of the house until they finally began to cut out.\n-Very shocking, and with this price I was expecting it to cut right when I left my bedroom.\n\nBattery:\nCan\u2019t compare only day one and I haven\u2019t wore them long.\n*3 month update\n-They last longer than my Air Pod Pros, but I always have noise cancellation on with my Air Pod Pros, which drains the battery. Air Pod Pros last about 3-4 hours. While Glorex is about 5 to 6 hours.\n\nFeatures:\n-Golrex for $30-40 you get led screen, volume control, Siri, and a few more, but Air Pod pros clearly win in this category.\n\nFeel:\nThey both feel like a high quality products.\n\nCase:\nGolrex features are actually better than Air Pod Pros when it comes to the case. The size is bulkier though, but if that doesn\u2019t bother you. Golrex is the clear winner in this category!\n\nPhone connection:\nBoth connect easy.\n\nSound quality:\n-This is where I was skeptical, but it\u2019s honestly not bad.\n-The bass is really good on the Golrex, but the blend between the voices and bass are nowhere near Air Pod Pro level.\n\nComfortability:\nGolrex feels great in my ears and they don\u2019t fall out vs Air Pod Pros feel sketchy at times while working out and I have knocked them out a couple of times.\n\nColor:\nGolrex wins in this category. The air pod pros are just white and nothing special to them.\n\nShower:\nGolrex claims iPX7. I haven\u2019t went swimming with them yet, but I did shower. My music didn\u2019t muffle one time vs Air Pod Pros, which are IPX4, they will go out on you in the shower and you have to let them dry for them to come back. This is annoying, $200 and they are only IPX4!\n\nConclusion:\nI left a review for a reason. l felt as a customer I got more than I expected. Really good overall earbuds being wireless and not corded.\nAre these Air Pod Pros? no.\nAre they good earbuds? yes.\nDo you need to spend for $200 instead of these? That\u2019s up to you. But, if you\u2019re on a budget I would not spend $200. These work honestly just fine for working out, cutting the grass, etc.\n\nHope this helps anyone looking to buy. This is not a paid review, just leaving my honest feedback.\n\nP.S. I will be using these more than the shower, and alternating with my Air Pod Pros.\n\n3 Month Update:\nThey still work. I also found new tips for the earbuds. They are called SpinFit CP100 Plus for IEM. These tips will make the sound of your earbuds even better! I advise you to change the tips of this earbuds to SpinFit CP100 Plus. These specific tips will help improve sound, isolation, and comfort. I got the medium for my ears, but they have: Small, Medium, and Large.\n\n*4 Month Update:\n\nThe left earbud has stopped working completely, but after contacting Golrex, they shipped a new set to me for free through their lifetime warranty. Make sure to register your product if you decide to get these earbuds to activate the Lifetime Warranty.",
        "Bought these to replace my old pair that had broken. These headphones are comfortable and easy to wear. I use them when doing intense exercise as well as just doing things around the house. They stay in place and have a good battery life and are easy to recharge. They have a good volume level and seem easy to pair with my cell phone. Happy with this product.",
        "Amazing over-ear headphones! These are so comfortable & very well made. Since I started working out again, I needed some over-ear headphones & these are great. They don't fall or slip as the tips (it does come with 3 different sizes to choose from), sits comfortably in your ears & wraps almost completely around your ears.\n\nThe sound is powerful, especially if you listen to music with a lot of bass like I do. The treble is outstanding as well, words are crisp even through the bass.\n\nSometimes, I usually have just one side in & the other hanging off my ear & it stays put. I'm clumsy so here & there I will hit it off my ear & this thing has bounced off of everything in my home & is unbelievably durable.\n\nThe battery life is soooooo good! I've literally gone a week without charging it & that's with using it for at least 3-4 hours every morning! That might not seem very long but I've had others that would only last a couple days before having to charge them again. These come with a charger but since everything we have are C-cord connectef, I just use what is available. It only takes a couple hours, if even, to be at full charge.\n\nI will definitely be getting another one of these once these go kaput... that's how good they are! I highly recommend you get one, too... you won't regret it!!",
        "This product is seriously an amazing value. It does almost everything better than the majority of similar name brand products. Where it falters is sound quality. It is pretty good but it's definitely not amazing. Highs, lows and mids are all pretty okay but all are a little muddy. The mids are the muddiest which is what makes it sound like you're listening just a little under water. Audio quality is still good and again, better than some name brand products. Overall, amazing for well under fourty bucks.\n\nThe rest is pretty nice. Carry/charge case is a little big but that's what you get for over the ear buds. The readout on the inside is really nice but not totally needed. Fit heirs on the med-large ear size, is comfortable and overall feel, fit and finish of everything is middle-high quality. Seems rugged and I hugely appreciate the physical buttons for control rather than touch buttons like the vast majority of name brand competitors. Battery life is alright on the buds at around 4-5hrs because the case will charge them about 4x or more. Not sure how they'll hold up over time but they're so cheap they're borderline disposable ~1yr.",
        "I love that they wrap around my ears, so that they don't fall off when I run. They look and sound great, no complaints. They were very easy to set up. Noise canceling? Hard to say honestly... I think it's what you expect. Charging is easy/fast.",
        "I wouldn't call these noise cancelling BUT i will say they hit the mark on every other feature. Range on these is amazing. I can go into another room. downstairs, outside and still have good sound and even talk on the phone. I use these in the shower when I WASH MY HAIR. these are my shower head phones. not only do they not fall off, but i can wear them to wash my hair. Come on.",
        "Good sound, pairs easily, holds a charge. I\u2019ve bought 2 pair\u2014 had a problem with the second, but the seller replaced it promptly. Great customer service.",
        "Absolutely love these. Great battery life. It even tells you how much you have left for each ear piece. They stay in place so it's a perfect fit. They are also lightweight. If you don't like just earbuds and want a more secure fit, this is for you."

Every now and again, I have to shift them to adjust, but I think that's normal. I'm pretty content with the quality, and I even fall asleep with them on sometimes.

        "I've been using these headphones literally every day for more than a year, and they're still performing extremely well.\n\nThey reliably and consistently connect to my devices. When I power these headphones up, I simply know that they're going to connect. Not so with my previous headphones that cost nearly as much. With my previous headphones (that did not have any noise cancellation feature), it was a roll of the dice every time I wanted to connect to my devices. Sometimes I would have to cycle them 2 or 3 times just to get them to connect.\n\nThe build quality is excellent. Battery life is also very good...diminished somewhat if the noise cancelling feature is enabled. They're also comfortable to wear for hours on end.\n\nI would definitely buy these headphones again. They're a very good value.\n\nAlthough I rarely use it, the noise cancellation feature is robust, especially for mid-range frequencies. A characteristic of any noise-cancellation technology is a slight sensation of over-pressure, but it's not objectionable. It's most noticeable when the noise cancellation feature is first enabled, and again when it's switched off.\n\nI highly recommend these headphones for daily use.",
        "Back in 2019 I purchased the TaoTronics SoundSurge 46 headphones and I love them. They're no longer for sale on Amazon and they Toatronics US won't send their headphones overseas, so I ordered a these ZIHNIC headphones as a possible replacement as the earpads have fallen off and disintergrated.\n\nI really like them. The sound is great, although a tad boomy but that can be a good thing depending on the music you like.\n\nMy only complaint is that the Bluetooth range/distance is really poor and I dearly would love to find a pair as good as these or the taotronics that has the range the taotronics had. The ZIHNIC's start to lose the connection even at 5m sometimes and you'd be lucky to get 15m in a straight line before losing the connection completely. With the Taotronics I could be 100m line of sight and still have a great connection. Or be 20m away and behind two steel shed walls and still get a connection.\n\nThey're tough and the noise cancelling is great but not quite as good as the Taotronics. Close enough though.\n\nSo if anyone knows of a set of bluetooth (preferably 5.0+) headphones please recommended them.\n\nIf you're sitting close to the bluetooth transmitter with the ZIHNIC's then they're ideal. Great for the price.\n\nAnd battery life is fantastic but I do tend to top them up at least every two days.",
        "the noise canceling is a little weak. I just play grey noise when I need silence. The sound quality is good for music. Price was right. Nice product over all, satisfied customer.",
        "What's not to like? Comfortable, good sound quality, long lasting battery life. Would buy again.",
        "I got this because I was having trouble hearing audio while on flights. I am sure that they do not work as well as the $200-300 sets that are sold but they seem to work quite well for me. I can hear audio without having to strain and the noise cancellation reduces the background noise sufficiently. The battery life is quite robust and they charge up quickly. The carrying case is nice and I don't worry about them breaking in my backpack. I only use these a couple hours a month and so they were well worth the money for me.",
        "Sound quality is good with a lot of bass. Integrated microphone is not the best but decent enough to make calls\n\nThe noise cancelling works great and is reducing background noise greatly however it makes some white noise, which is not really important when you are in a noisy environement thus the button to activate and deactivate the noise canceling is a nice addition.\n\nThis comes with a jack connector and cable, I am able to plug it in the entertainment system during flight.\nI had seats near the jet engine, kids .. and the noise canceling is perfect for those situations plus the audio is much better than any headsets handed out during flights",
        "Bought these to replace my failing earbuds...They work great. Sound quality is excellent and the noise cancellation works very well. These are a great value for the money if you are looking for good, comfortable headphones but don't want to spend a bunch! If I had a complaint, it would be the bluetooth does take a bit to connect...my earbuds would connect almost instantly - these take 10 or 15 seconds to connect. Its not that big of a deal, but its the only criticism I have!",
        "The headphones came nicely packaged which is a plus. They also came charged which is super awesome. They are comfortable so far, I'm no expert but the sound quality is amazing. My one drawback so far is that I have to disconnect from my phone in order to connect to my laptop. I mean it's not a huge deal since I generally only use one device at a time.\n\nI haven't tried the calling feature as yet. All in all if you follow the Manual the setup should be seamless."

        "I love these headphone. Great price, very sturdy, and great fit to my head. They have great sound quality, only has noise cancellation when turned all the way up tho lol. Only thing I\u2019m not crazy about is that you can hear what\u2019s being played when they\u2019re turned up and I\u2019m wearing them. Don\u2019t like when others can hear what I\u2019m listening to. But for the price, they\u2019re pretty great!",

        "These headphones work well and are very easy to use. I like the way they look and the sound quality is great!",
        "Bang for your buck, these are great. I got these to use with work calls and they've been great. While they don't have \"killer\" sound, they sound very good for both calls and entertainment. I haven't had a need to push the volume to the max, so I don't know how well they perform under that demand. I've been able to use these with Microsoft Teams for calls and they work just as expected.\n\nFor the cost, you may not find a better wireless set of over the ear headphones to give a try!"

        "I highly recommend these earbuds for anyone looking for Bluetooth earbuds. I have owned several ear only buds, but always have them fall out. This set of over the ear buds work great. I have not had any issues with them falling out or off my ears. I\u2019m extremely impressed with the range capabilities and quality of the units. The battery last extremely long and charges, from the case, quickly. I have the ability now to listen to my phone and music from another room without the sound cutting out.\nThey are very comfortable to wear and easy to clean, which is recommended by the manufacturer and audiologist to prevent ear infection. A little gentle soap on a soft cloth is all it takes and the buds come off to be able to rinse them under the faucet.\nI highly recommend them for anyone looking for over the ear earbuds.",
        "So I\u2019ve had these earbuds for a little over a year. I originally got them so I could do phone calls in the car. In regards to that, they work decently, but sometimes people wouldn\u2019t be able to hear me too great. That is pretty much the only con for these.\n\nThey\u2019re awesome for listening though. If I\u2019m at work and need to listen to something on my phone I just pop them in my ear and I\u2019m good to go. They automatically connect to the phone once you take them out of the charging case, so that\u2019s super convenient. The sound is good quality, crisp and clean. They also have 3 different size ear attachments so should be good for most people. I was fine with the default one so haven\u2019t had to mess with that. They are comfortable even when using for a while whereas normally\n\nWhat honestly amazed me was the customer support. I had an issue with them due to misuse from my children. I contacted the seller and asked if I could buy a replacement part. They ended up shipping me a new one free of charge. This was just a few weeks ago after I had them for about a year so kudos to them for the amazing support. There is a lifetime warranty, but you need to register within 15 days of buying. Make sure to do this! I\u2019m guessing they felt pity for me, but it was very nice regardless.\n\nOverall, very satisfied with this purchase. Especially with the price these are a must grab!",
        "I have Meniere's Disease and have found over the years that ear buds make the pressure in my ears worse. These are the first earbuds that I have found that wear comfortably, they don't fly off every time you turn your head, the sound is fantastic, and most importantly they don't hurt my ears!!!!! The charge seems to last forever and the case is great. I have them paired to my phone and my computer. I have found that sometimes I have to temporarily turn off the blue tooth on my phone in order to have them pick up my computer, but it's as easy as pushing a button and they switch to the computer, hit the button to turn blue tooth back on and they immediately go back to my phone. My husband has a pair that he uses for work and for hands free phone while driving and I plan to get my daughter a pair for Christmas. Love them.",
        "I love these, deducting just one star because mic is just not sensitive enough for my voice, but otherwise for listening they're so good! Just ordered my second pair, I wear them all day every day at work, usually alternating sides but sometimes both when needed to helps me stay sane while working with loud barking dogs. Both earbuds connected easily, sound great and have such good battery life, plus the case charging feature is so handy. I am only replacing after my first set took repeated dives into the dog grooming tub. Understandably sound quality is not so great now. Took apart to clean and dry as well as I could, and they do still play, but very quietly now lol.",
        "I discovered something interesting about these ear buds. If you charge the base, and then place them in their cradle it charges them without having to plug them into a charging source.\nThey're comfortable to wear, connect quickly to my phone and I love the volume buttons. The best part, I have fallen asleep with them in and didn't have sore ears afterwards. Music is awesome with these and the charge lasts a very long time. So far, I have nothing but 5 stars for these.",
        "The sound is better quality than Beats, I love all the colors I bought two. There\u2019s a digital notification when charge is getting low. Really amazing and better price than name brands.",
        "I love these earbuds! They don't slip out of my ears like others have in the past. The sound quality is amazing. Quick charging with a cute little case.",
        "Se pueden cargar muy f\u00e1cilmente y claro el %de carga,",
