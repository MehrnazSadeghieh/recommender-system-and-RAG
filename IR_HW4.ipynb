They are warm but not overwhelmingly so. Details in the mid and high are clear and non fatiguing. They lack in the bass for my personal preference, but a mild tune with a digital EQ can get the slam I prefer. Highly recommend for easy listening and the price to performance is hard to beat.', 'These are incredible headphones. They have a rich and vibrant sound with deep punchy bass and precise crisp highs. They are lightweight and comfortable to wear; I can wear for them long binge-watch sessions as well as extended music listening. They do benefit from some breaking in and maybe a bit of tweaking in a program like Peace or Voicemeter to tune the levels.\\n\\nMy favorite part of these headphones is how lightweight and comfortable they are when wearing them for long periods of time as well as the overall sound quality. The closed backs provide an excellent soundscape while maintaining privacy and accentuating the punch of the bass.\\n\\nThese are clear, precise, and get loud with ease ( I use them with a Fios amp).\\n\\nI would definitely recommend these headphones for someone seeking a premium, fantastic sounding, comfortable pair of headphones.', \"Ok so I don't use audiophile terms really, alot of them I'm not sure if I really even understand haha. I do own several headphones, somewhere around 50ish over the ears. I run them off my phone with a fiio a3 or I run them off my Yamaha home stereo receiver hooked to a liquid spark amp. Very modest indeed. The only details I'll get into besides sound is comfort because looks and build speak for them selves, they're awesome. The comfort is perfect, once on your head you forget they are even there. Unlike the jaw breaking force of the Sennheisers. Or the super loose fit of say the sph9500. Ok so now on to the sound!\\n\\nSOUND PART OF MY REVIEW: as I said, I don't really use alot of audiophile terms I am better at understanding sound by comparison to other headphones or speakers. So at $200 to $300 bucks you have some real heavy hitters. You have alot of great options. To name a few of them I'm guessing you either own or are trying to decide from. You have the Sennheisers 58x, 6xx, 600 and 650. You've also got the likes of hifiman 400i and 4xx the Phillips Fidelio x2hr and the Beyer 770,880,990 just to name a few I foolishly own over 3/4 of these so I feel as if I can speak with pretty good knowledge of what you can expect. So the star of the show, THE BASS! These to me have the best/most bass of the lot. Sub bass is great, snappy drum bass is great, low end grunt from guitars and other stringed instruments is awesome. Mid range is very warm and cozy with very little bass bleed, which is amazing for how much thump these have. The mids are only rivaled by the 58x and 600 variants. I cannot honestly say which is better they're just two different flavors but both equally delicious. The meze is warm and extremely present mixed with Bass where as the Sennheisers are getting very present with much less warrants from bass but so extremely accurate it's almost a religious experience lol. Now the high-end is where things become very difficult. The 99s do not offer the high quality antalitical effortless hight end of the Sennheisers or the planar hifimans but what you get in return is a rolled off super sweet relaxing hight end. Like a very good vinyl pressing compared to a CD if you will. So overall if you want accurate amazing time tested reference sound go with the Sennheisers, if you want hard to drive bassless but very good mids and highs go with hifiman. If you want overall performer with strong v shaped sound and amazing soundstage get the x2s. If your like me and love your bass, and want amazing mids, soundstage and comfort with easy on the ear treble get these meze 99 classic or neo! If I could only have one of these headphones it would be a real hard choice between the 58x and these meze 99s but I'm pretty sure I would take the meze 99. Best bass, best looks, best out of the box accessories and easiest to drive (nothing more than a cellphone required) I hope I was able to give something of an idea of what to expect from these.\", \"SOUND: I've had these headphones for almost a year now. When I was shopping for headphones, I wanted something with a warm sound signature and good bass. I am very treble sensitive and these headphones have the perfect sound signature. I listen to a lot of synth-pop and EDM, music sounds fun and exciting. The bass doesn't 'slam', it's more about the sub-bass which I feel are these headphone's bread and butter.\\n\\nGAMING: Very cinematic in games and sounds really good especially in single-player games. However, because these are closed back headphones I don't think the sound stage is great, it can feel a bit 'cramped', and these probably aren't the best for FPS games.\\n\\nCOMFORT: Unfortunately, I don't find these as comfortable as other folks claim. Even after stretching these out there is still a noticeable clamp and adjusting them can be uncomfortable. The cord is awful and splits very close to your neck and there is no way to adjust it; I find the cord frequently rubbing up against my neck and it's very irritating. The pads can become hot and sweaty; I actually bought memory foam pads to replace them because the stock ones are so bad, but unfortunately the memory foam ruined the sound signature of these headphones. I usually wear my headphones all day but I frequently find myself taking these off whenever I can and is a big reason I'm looking to replace these even though I love the sound signature.\\n\\nOverall, these headphones sport a warm, bass heavy sound signature that sounds great for music and single-player games, but it's limited sound-stage and closed-back nature can make it feel cramped and not good for FPS games. While I adore the sound signature, if comfort is a big concern you may be disappointed.\", 'Si bien son un poco caros, son audifonos premium de alta calidad con un sonido increible, no se sienten pesados, las almohadillas son comodas incluso durante largas sesiones de uso, la diadema es de buena calidad y se extiende bastante. Totalmente recomendados.', '', \"These headphones are not bass cannons by any means. Reviewers saying these are bass heavy are probably used to very flat sounding audiophile headphones. If all you care about is the amount of muddy bass then go with a pair of Sony MDRXB's. Where these headphones excel is the ability to deliver great clear bass that isn't muddy, as well as crystal clear vocals. They sound very good out of the box but I would recommend an external Amp or DAC that has bass controls on it as it does improve the sound quality. The soundstage is better than most consumer headphones in this price range but not as good as the DT 770 Pro, however these do not have any of the harsh treble that the DT 770 has which can be ear-piercing at times, and they have much better bass.\\n\\nThe headphones are the most comfortable headphones I have ever worn. They are even comfortable when wearing glasses. The clamping force isn't very tight so they would not be the best pair of headphones to walk down the street with on. They also have good passive noise isolation but not great as they don't clamp on your head too tight.\\n\\nThe materials all feel very premium. The leather on the earcups is very nice to the touch and feels much better than leather earcups on other headphones in the same price range.\\n\\nThe included hard-shell case looks great and doesn't feel cheap by any means. It is a tad larger than other headphone cases however this makes it very easy to put them in the case or take them out on the fly which I prefer.\\n\\nThe mic quality is good but not great. I have $50 earbuds that have a better microphone than these but they are still good enough for phone/video calls and I have never had anyone on the other end complaint that they couldn't hear me.\\n\\nI had an issue with my headphones when they arrived. One of the earpads had been damaged in the shipping process and wouldn't stay on the earcup. Customer support was very quick to fix the issue and offered to ship me new earpads, and entirely new headset, as well as compensation which I was not expecting from a premium headphone manufacturer. A+ customer support from a small vendor.\\n\\nI would recommend these headphones if:\\n-You listen to a wide variety of music which includes bass heavy tracks as well as more vocal focused music.\\n-You will mainly be using these headphones while stationary such as at a desk.\\n-You want comfortable headphones you can wear all day.\\n-You want to enjoy your music and not analyze every note.\\n\\nI would not recommend these headphones if you only listen to one genre of music or need exceptional passive noise isolation.\", 'Jamais entendu un son aussi naturel de cette qualité, avec en prime des bonnes basses !!! Et que dire du confort, grâce au double arceau on ne le ressent absolument pas sur sa tête !! Gros coup de cœur', '', 'What can I say these are amazing, you hear things in the music that you don’t hear from cheaper headphones.\\n\\nI use AirPods for convenience and when I want to sit down and just listen to music I use these. I currently just use Apple Music with the highest quality possible and just plugged in to my phone. I do plan on getting an amp but I’m debating whether they can sound better.\\n\\nAnyway I am very happy with these.', 'Os contaré mi experiencia de cómo y porqué llegué a escoger estos auriculares, los Meze 99, y cuál es mi opinión sobre ellos, porque personalmente a la hora de gastarme esta cantidad de dinero me gusta estar lo más seguro que puedo de mi compra y las opiniones detalladas me son de gran ayuda a la hora de decidir, aunque la mayoría de las que leí se centraban casi únicamente en la calidad de sonido y creo que hay otros aspectos importantes a la hora de escoger unos auriculares que te tienen que durar mucho tiempo. Así que procuraré no dejarme nada y ser totalmente sincero.\\n\\nAntes que nada, al comprar unos auriculares hay que tener muy claro el uso que les vas a dar y el presupuesto del que dispones. También evaluar si los quieres con cable o bluetooth (se dice que con el bluetooth pierden información de sonido). En mi caso buscaba unos auriculares que me permitieran disfrutar de una experiencia inmersiva, pues los usaría principalmente en el autobús. Por este motivo me decanté por unos de diadema circumaurales (los que envuelven toda la oreja. Existen también los intraurales, que son los pequeños que te metes dentro del oído, y los supraurales, que son de diadema pero no cubren toda la oreja), pues suelen dar más calidad de sonido y me parecen más cómodos.\\nMi presupuesto era de 200 euros aprox. como máximo.\\n\\nEn casa tengo unos Beyerdynamic DT990 Pro que utilizo para edición de audio. Estos dan una calidad de sonido excelente y neutro y cumplen su función a la perfección dentro del estudio, pero necesitaba ahora unos cascos versátiles y de uso más lúdico, no para editar sino para disfrutar de música de distintos géneros en cualquier parte, y los Beyerdynamic no eran recomendables para llevar a la calle por varios motivos:\\n•Tienen una impedancia muy alta (si desconoces qué es la impedancia, vale la pena informarse) de 250ohms, y por lo tanto a la hora de escuchar música desde el móvil se oye muy flojo; necesitan ser conectados a la tarjeta de sonido que tengo en casa (existen también amplificadores portátiles) para sacarle todo su potencial. Por lo tanto necesitaba unos con una impedancia baja.\\n•Son auriculares semi-abiertos, es decir, no aíslan el sonido exterior. En mi caso eso es una pega por que en el bus molestas a los otros pasajeros. Del mismo modo también oyes al bebé llorón del asiento delantero. Por lo tanto necesitaba unos de cerrados (que también me servirían a la hora de grabar voces).\\n•Tienen un cable exageradamente largo, pues están pensados para utilizar en estudio, pero fuera de él es un contra pues necesitas algo portable y práctico. Por lo tanto necesitaba unos con cable ligero y extraíble.\\n\\nAdemás, hay otros aspectos a tener en cuenta que, después de mirar diversas listas de mejores cascos, no he visto.\\nEstos aspectos son:\\n•Que se puedan quitar las almohadillas, pues al cabo de un tiempo se ensucian y hay que lavarlas.\\n•Que el cable sea de quita y pon, para reemplazarlo si se rompe o poder intercambiarlo por otro más largo o corto según te convenga.\\n•Que sean ergonómicos para podértelos poner en el cuello.\\n•Que tengan una buena funda para que no se rompan en el transporte del uso diario.\\n\\nOtras características que para mí también son importantes son el diseño y los materiales de construcción.\\n\\nComo es lógico es muy difícil encontrar unos cascos que cumplan tantos requisitos. Aún así, hice una búsqueda intensiva durante varios días, y me decidí por los Audio Technica M50x (que también tienen la versión en bluetooth), del que leí innumerables reseñas positivas. Así que fui a probarlos a mi tienda habitual y me sorprendió lo increíblemente malos que eran: incómodos, se escuchaban de pena, (además de bastante feos y construídos enteramente en plástico, cosas que ya sabía pero podia sacrificar en pro de lo otro que supuestamente tenía).\\n\\nAsí que me puse de nuevo a buscar y a leer opiniones y encontré unos auriculares que me atrajeron de entrada por su particular diseño: los Meze 99. Vi también que se podía quitar el cable (algo de lo que disponen muy pocos modelos), que tenían una impedancia asombrosamente baja (26ohms) y aunque eran de una marca hasta entonces desconocida para mí, había muy buenas reseñas.\\nMe gustaron mucho pues era el único modelo que cumplía con todo lo que buscaba, pero no lo tenían en mi tienda de confianza así que me arriesgué y los compré sin probarlos previamente. Aunque los Classic me flipan, al final me quedé con el Neo por ser 100 euros más barato y también es atractivo (lo compré en enero 2021 por 200 euros).\\n\\nEscribo todo esto pues, después de un mes de haberlos adquirido y probado regularmente. He de confesar que me han sorprendido gratamente. Mis espectativas ya eran altas, pero al abrir su cuidada caja, ver su elegante funda rígida y descubrir unos cascos que se ven fantásticos (están tremendos y se palpa calidad cuando los sostienes) con sus acabados metálicos, me quedé realmente sorprendido. Además del cable y la funda, incluye un adaptador jack.\\n\\nSu calidad de sonido es buena si la comparo con los Beyerdynamic, que son una bestia. No soy un entendido en la materia pero no creo que exageren ninguna frecuencia; estan bastante equilibrados.\\nDestaco que, como otros cascos cerrados que he probado, al cabo de una hora larga de escucha, tienes que quitártelos un rato pues te empiezan a molestar las orejas.\\nTambién quiero comentar que me los enviaron en su caja original, sin ningún otro envoltorio que la cubriera, y se podrían haber dañado fácilmente durante el transporte, cosa que por suerte no pasó. No se si esto es cosa de amazon, del propio fabricante o de la compañia de reparto.\\n\\nEn caso de que le encontrara pegas en un futuro reeditaría esta reseña, pero se los ve resistentes, un objeto al que probablemente le cogeré cariño y me acompañará durante muchos años.', ''], 'detail': \"Meze 99 Neo | Wired Closed-Back Headset for Audiophiles | Gaming | Podcasts | Home Office | Over-Ear Headphones with Mic and Self Adjustable Headband The uptown audiophile's delight: 99 NEO closed-back headphones offer a modern twist to the iconic 99 series, blending Meze Audio's signature sound and design.

The quality is very high, given the price point. I would easily put these up against most, way more expensive, headphones in both sound and performance.\\n\\nThe rechargeable case is a really cool feature. It uses USB-C, which I really like. The outward display is excellent. The battery life is extremely long and the quality of the headphones is very good for ear bud style headphones.\\n\\nThe range of the Bluetooth is phenomenal. I can get around my entire double lot without breaking up. Additionally, the option to charge the case via USB-C or a wireless charger is a really great feature.\\n\\nThese headphones were easy to pair with any Bluetooth device and quickly adapt to whatever media you're feeding to them.\\n\\nFrom a person who has owned very expensive wireless headphones in the $200 to $300 range, I would happily buy multiple sets of these headphones in lieu of buying one very expensive set.\\n\\nAs far as style and comfort goes, these are some of the most comfortable earbuds I've ever worn. They fit very nicely around the ear and they come with a few different attachments so you can change the size of the earbud for maximum comfort. The quality of the sleeves are very high and the fit is very nice. It is very soft and smooth material.\\n\\nOverall, I would highly recommend these to anyone who is an avid listener of podcasts or music on any device and frequently uses headphones to not disturb those around them. These headphones do a great job at canceling outside noise and have a fantastic audio quality to them, especially given their price point. The sleek black design of these with very clear indicator lights makes them as aesthetically pleasing as they are comfortable. The case is very smooth and feels like frosted glass with a clear charging indicator on the front to check the remining capacity of the device. Also much to my surprise the headphones were at 94% charge when they arrived .\\n\\nOverall, this is just a great product and I would highly recommend it\", '', '', \"So far I really like these earbuds. They were extremely easy to connect via Bluetooth on my phone and no other set up besides that was needed. immediately after I took the plastic tabs off of each earbud it began charging from the precharged case that they came in. I really like how the case can be charged via USB and that it gives you a read out on how charged the earbuds are. Using the earbuds they do have quite a bit of bass and the volume can get decently high which I love. I also like that in total there are 3 different sizes on the ear piece part that goes into the ear. So that if the size that comes with it is too big or small you can try these out to get a better fit for your individual ear. I have tried out at least 3 other different types of wireless earbuds and these so far seem to be my favorite just because of the increased base and volume. They also seem to fit comfortably around my ear and don't wiggle too much. I plan to try them out while on a jog and I think they will actually do pretty well. The charging case really is pretty cool. the wireless earbuds snap into place magnetically so that if you have it open in your purse they don't just fall right out and mingle with everything else inside of your purse. The instruction manual is very simple and easy to read it even gives a great grid to refer back to for how to use the button on the wireless earbud. I do wish that it had a separate button for volume increase and volume decrease but so far the button seems to work OK for everything that it needs. Because the earbuds have a primary and secondary designation the batteries are different for each. The battery of the primary earbud dies faster than that of the secondary earbud which is normal. If you get a call on your phone while you're using the earbuds you have the option to answer it with one click or you can reject it with a long click. I really like the company that makes these. I have bought several different models from them and like them all. Very affordable. Considering getting my husband a pair. The manual says that they will stayed paired for up to 33 feet from your phone. They will stay charged for 8-10 hours. It only takes 2 hours to fully charge them on the case. It takes 3 hours for the case to recharge itself. Love how you can be mobile and charge these while out and about.\", \"I've purchased previous headphones from this same company and each time I’m very impressed with their quality. This time, I’m really loving these new headphones because I can use this to speak to friends on the phone while listen to music at the same time.\\n\\nOkay now, before you read on you need to understand. I wasn't looking for an awesome listening experience. I was looking for a inexpensive set that would produce sound at a level that still makes them useful while flying. I needed something that would last, sound great and have great quality.\\n\\nThe outside case:\\nSmall enough to fit into your pocket or handbag. There is an indicator on the outside that tells you how much battery life is remaining which is so cool and it will constantly charge your headphones when placed within the case. The lid is kept close with a small magnet, which is a nice thought. Unless your trying to close it without making any noise as the mentioned magnet loves to make it close with a very noticeable snap. Charging is very simple and the lights indicating the battery level makes knowing whats going on very easy.\\n\\nThe buds:\\nThey fit nicely, pairing was incredibly easy to complete and they do connect pretty much flawlessly every time they are taken out of the case. They sound great overall. You can control the volume and pause what your watching / listening to on the buds by placing your finger on the right spot.\\n\\nWith all of that said, if your looking for a set of buds that will give you the performance then it's worth checking out.

I started using these september year ago, and they worked great and still do in terms of audio. However, as of these past few months, the headphones have had some issues. The outer coating of the headphone padding has started to peel and shed off, leaving black specks on my face and neck. Additionally, the max charge has been steadily falling for a couple of months. Before, I could wake up early, fall asleep with them on, and wake up in the morning without them being on low battery. However, it has gradually dropped to about 18 hours, and today, they were only able to hold a charge for 13 hours. Again, these have seen pretty much daily use from me and have seen some rather unfavorable conditions (nothing too bad, just some light sprinkles and I don't believe water got inside), so this may just be a result of constant use.

Unsynched my Cowin E7 from my phone and added these. I noticed right away the E7 logo on the side and was like what the heck is this? I grabbed my old pair and was like. Umph whatever.\\n\\nI put them on and felt a bit off. But again thinking its because they are new silly goose. As you can see from my pictures, I USED AND ABUSED MY COWINS! I make music and they were a downgrade from my JVCs which I had for years. I bought my Cowins in 2019 I believe maybe sooner. I love them. I was shocked at the bass and the clarity of my music, other music and movies alike. They are perfect for the $50 I slapped down vs the $200 for my pair prior.\\n\\nWell needless to say the sound quality on these are trash in my opinion. I was listening to a song and was like this really isn\\'t right. So I like the genius I am not, put both pairs on and decided to switch back and force between the two during different parts of the song to compare and yeah they don\\'t live up.\\n\\nThe bass is weak which is a no go for me. The Cowins always had the bass on point so when I plugged into other sources like speakers and my car it was not too much nor too weak. These new E7 I can tell you right now if I don\\'t remember every time to mix correctly will have the bass way too deep every single time. Drawing out other components most likely.\\n\\nEven trying to watch a movie they are not as loud as my Cowins. I used the hold them side by side and crank it up test. I use to get stopped and stared at on the train, bus or walking, \"Those are seriously loud 😐\" \"Dang those are some good headphones\" \"How are those so loud?\" \"I can hear every word of what your listening to\" are just some of the comments/compliments I have gotten over the years. I do not think I will be getting the same reaction from these E7s.\\n\\nI\\'m super saddened by this as I\\'m seeing the old versions are no longer available. And it sucks. There\\'s nothing wrong with my cowins except they are very stretched out and as you can see the ear covers are just decimated. I think I\\'m going to gift my son with these new ones as he just uses them to game mostly.\\n\\nI\\'m really really sad you guys. Like pressed about this. Those Cowins were perfection. What the heck happened? I\\'m again really sad I didn\\'t buy 12 of them sooner to be prepared for the dreadful day they stop working on me. I just don\\'t want to think about it.\\n\\nDid I mention I\\'m sad?', 'I’m autistic and I suffer from sensory overload.

These feel and are premium quality. Connecting to Bluetooth is super easy and the app also has a few settings that you can adjust for your preference. After hooking up I put on a song that I know has bass and I let it rip. When I say these sound good even in high bass, it's an understatement. These are the most fun headphones you can get and for the price you can't compete. From now on I will make sure I get a set every other year.\", 'This is my pick of the year! Maybe the century!\\n\\nI am both Autistic, and also a little biased.\\n\\nI had the previous generation skull crushers. The left side broke, and skull candy replaced them in warranty for free.\\n\\nI wore those replacement headphones for about four more years until the bass slider started acting up.\\n\\nSo when it came time to by a new pair, it was between these and the ANC model. The ANC model was about 100 dollars more, and I’m not a big fan of ANC’s because they usually have a high pitched hiss whenever there’s no noise coming through.\\n\\nI was super happy when I found the non-ANC model. Because they were cheaper and most closely resembled my old pair.\\n\\nThe bass is just a touch stronger than the last generation. Highs and mids are nice too.\\n\\nI really like the bass slider, because anything with a muddy baseline, you can turn down. Also anytime you are listening to an audible book, if the voice is low, you can turn the bass down.\\n\\nAll in all I would buy these again.\\n\\nI have recommended to several friends, some Autistic, some not. Everyone that tries them wants a pair and are really excited they are so affordable.', 'I like these . They really seal to your ears & the sound is nice. However the volume is not all that much. In my opinion the volume could be louder. Thes are however easy to link to Bluetooth & stay linked. Easy to use. Thank you Amazon.', 'These are extremely comfortable, easy to pack, and the buttons are easy to press and use to connect to different devices. The battery life is INCREDIBLY long and the sound is absolutely incredible from one song to the next. The Quality of the Noise Cancellation is really next level, but not advisable for people, mainly kids or people who are not stationary or in a safe place to use in public. The only reason being that it can block out many or ALL voices that could be trying to get their attention or warn them of obstacles. Thats why I only use these at home, in a vehicle I’m not driving, or when I am doing a solo housekeeping job so I am aware of all the tools I am using.', \"I wear them mostly to the gym but also at home the sound is amazing the battery life is actually crazy and there so comfortable only thing I noticed is they do slide off a bit when I do certain exercises but that's as expected overall best headphones I've every purchased\", \"Overall I am very pleased with these headphones. I'm not super knowledgeable or picky on sound details so I cannot give a super techy sounding review. That being said if you're a normal person that is just looking for a solid pair of headphones that aren't overpriced these are great. I mainly got these for the gym which they are great for because of the bass. They are not the noise cancelling version so don't get them and write a bad review because of that because you'll look ridiculous. haha. Again very pleased which has been my general experience with skull candy and the extra charging cable thrown in is a nice touch. Well done skull candy.\", \"I've owned the first wireless Crushers and now the Crusher Evo. Like a lot of reviews describe it, they're absolutely fun to use. If you're one of those people who has never owned a Skullcandy product - the 'Crusher bass' is not simply a equalizer bass boost that other headphone companies offer. There's a physical slider on the left headphone earcup right below the orange button. Sliding this upwards increases the vibrations generated by physical components within the headphone itself. You absolutely have to try it on maximum strength on some bass heavy music --- it will literally make your head rattle.\\n\\nMy personal favourite is watching movies on my ipad with the Crushers. Try out some bass heavy movies like Michael Bay film, flight scenes from Top Gun Maverick, or the ending sequence of Avengers Endgame and you'll understand what I mean. And don't even get me started on playing games with the Crusher Evos --- absolutely mind blowing :)\\n\\nFor the price you pay for Crusher Evos, they're definitely worth the value compared to other brands at the same price. I also use Tile for my keys/wallet at home, so having that feature built into the headphones is nice. There's also an app that you can download to your phone that allows you to further tweak the audio profile for optimal hearing.\\n\\nOverall, an awesome product and highly recommended to anyone looking for having a little skull-shaking fun with their movies/music.\"], 'detail': 'Skullcandy Crusher Evo Over-Ear Wireless Headphones with Sensory Bass, 40 Hr Battery, Microphone, Works with iPhone Android and Bluetooth Devices - True Black What is Crusher Tech?

Here's my detailed review highlighting the pros and cons:\\n\\n**Pros:**\\n1. **Immersive Stereo Sound:** The 16.2mm drivers deliver rich and immersive audio, making every beat crystal clear, whether you're working out, gaming, or simply enjoying music.\\n2. **Innovative Open Ear Design:** I love the open ear concept! It allows me to stay aware of my surroundings while enjoying music, ensuring safety during outdoor activities.\\n3. **Bluetooth 5.3 Connectivity:** The Bluetooth 5.3 technology provides a stable and seamless connection with my devices, allowing me to move freely without worrying about signal drops.\\n4. **Noise-Cancellation Mic:** The noise-cancellation mic ensures clear calls even in noisy environments, making it ideal for work calls and catching up with friends and family.\\n5. **Long Battery Life:** With an impressive 45 hours of playtime, these earbuds keep up with my active lifestyle without constantly needing a recharge.\\n6. **Comfortable Fit:** The earbuds are lightweight and ergonomically designed, providing a comfortable fit even during extended wear.\\n7. **Versatile Usage:** Perfect for sports, workouts, gaming, and everyday use, these headphones are incredibly versatile and cater to all my audio needs.\\n\\n**Cons:**\\n1. **Limited Bass:** While the sound quality is excellent, the bass could be slightly stronger for a more immersive audio experience, especially for bass enthusiasts.\\n2. **Not Fully Noise-Isolating:** The open ear design allows ambient sound, which is great for safety but might not be ideal for users seeking complete noise isolation in noisy environments.\\n\\nIn summary, these Open Ear Headphones are a game-changer for anyone with an active lifestyle. The combination of immersive sound, open ear design, and long battery life makes them a top choice for sports, workouts, and gaming enthusiasts. While there are minor drawbacks, the overall performance and versatility make these earbuds a fantastic investment. Highly recommended!\", 'I was looking for earbuds that didn’t seal my ear canal and that I could listen to my surroundings, and what a great surprise I got with these Truefree O1.\\n\\nI must say I was a little bit skeptical with the design, they looked a little weird but once you put them on, they feel just great. They’re very lite and comfortable. The fact that they don’t seal the ear canal is very useful, since you can walk or ride a bike or use them at the office and you can still hear what’s going on around you. Sound is decent, first because the driver is pretty large, but bass is not too powerful, mids and highs are nice, so for the casual music listener or for hearing podcasts or audio books they’re really good, for the hard core music listener, these aren’t the best option. Takes a little bit of time to get used to find the touch controls but no big deal.\\n\\nThe case is rather large but is understandable because of the design of the earbuds. Connecting to the phone is a breeze and they connect really fast just by opening the case. Battery life is awesome, I got almost 10 hours in a single charge.\\n\\nThese are great for the price and for daily use when you need to be aware of what’s going on in your surroundings, just don’t expect HiFi since these earbuds push the sound to your ears instead on injecting it inside your ear. Great value for the price.', \"These headphones make for a good option if you want open air pass-through sound. Theses headphones serve a specific purpose; if you want to be able to hear what's around you while listening to music. Ideally this is great for working out or running if you want to be able to hear cars as you're running on the side of the road for safety, these are it! You have to know that going into purchasing headphones like this because you can't expect the same booming quality sound with headphones like this that you would get out of in ear buds. That being said the sound quality is good it serves its purpose for listening to music. The bass is lacking, but that's to be expected. These feel pretty light around my ears not cumbersome. Did bot get uncomfortable after a few hours of wear I was able to run with them And they didn't fall out of place. It comes with a USB a to USB-C charger cord. Thumbs up for going USBC. Connection to my phone was incredibly easy It took no time at all and they came fully charged out of the box. The carrying case however is pretty large as you can see in the picture but these are also larger style buds that wrap around your ear so the case needs to fit a larger object. I wouldn't stick this case in my pocket to walk around with bc of the size, but perfect fit for a backpack or purse or small carrying crossbody bag. Definitely recommend if you're looking for an open ear style headphone. Battery life is solid with ab 10hrs on the headphones and another 45hrs from the case.\", 'Os fones são perfeitos, fiéis ao anúncio. Se encaixam bem, consigo escutar o som ambiente e curtir minhas músicas e outros áudios. A bateria dura bastante tempo e recarrega rápido.', '', \"These headphones are excellent value for the money. I tend to use headphones while at work, sometimes for many hours. I have always found it hard to find good sounding headphones / earbuds that are comfortable for lond periods of time, while being able to hear sounds around me. These are excellent! They are very comfortable, and feel kind of like you are wearing glasses. Even with many movements they don't fall off. The sound quality is very good, with good highs, mids, good base (There is a very slight lack in base, but it is very minimal). I really like that there is nothing in going directly in your ear. I feel that it is healthier for your ears, and also isn't gross to share headphones with someone else. I alos take many calls on my headphones (including business calls) so a good microphone is essential. The microphone on these is excellent. I highly recommend these headphones!\\n\\nThe only thing that could be considered a negative point, is the case is pretty big compared to other brands. It has to be larger to accomodate this style. The benefit is there is lots of battery power so they last a long time. However they aren't great fitting in your pocket for long times. But itn't a big deal, compared to all the good aspects of these headphones.\", 'Con gusto comparto mis puntos de vista y opinion sobre este par de auriculares de la marca truefree que son el modelo 01... primero que nada me sorprende lo comodos que son ya que puedes traerlos puestos por horas y en ningun momento molestan, son muy pero muy comodos y al ser cero intrusivos en los conductos auditivos de las orejas pues eso hace precisamente que sean muy comodos; ahora bien al estar viendo las especificaciones uno puede constatar que cuentan con un driver ENORME el cual hace bastante bien su trabajo y adicionalmente el contar con el codec de audio LDAC pues que mas podria decir, la calidad del audio entregada es muy bella pues se notan matices en la musica que no se lograrian notar con codecs de audio no tan especializados en ello asi que aqui tienen un gran punto a su favor, los tonos altos son cristalinos y bien manejados no calan en los oidos y son muy perceptibles, los tonos medios bien traidos al frente y los tonos bajos si bien no es su punto mas fuerte aun asi se hacen presente de una buena forma bien desenvueltos; obvio para todo ello siempre recomiendo \"jugar\" con los diferentes tipos de ecualizaciones que disponga su equipo ya sea celular o tables o laptop dependiendo para que los vayas a usar.\\nOtro excelente beneficio es que soportan dos dispositivos emparejados en este par de auriculares lo cual se agradece mucho y es facil conmutar entre ambos.\\nel volumen creo yo es el punto menos fuerte de estos auriculares pues a mi por ejemplo me gusta llevar el audio a niveles mas altos que los tipicos y pues aqui se quedan un poco cortos en ese aspecto, ahora bien aclaro ojo con esto pues estos auriculares estan diseñados y pensados en la seguridad al momento de traerlos puestos ya que son del tipo \"abierto\" y no son de los que entran con gomitas al canal auditivo del oido cosa que ya mencione al inicio, dejando esto bien especificado puedo decir que suenan muy detallado, la separacion de instrumentos es muy pero muy buena notandose matices que no podrias escuchar con auriculares sin LDAC y el volumen aunque no es su punto fuerte creo es lo suficientemente alto para disfrutar andando en la calle ya sea en un paseo en bicileta o patines o trotando o caminando y pues en realidad para ello fueron hecho este par de auriculares por lo que aclarado el punto puedo decir que cumplen perfectamente con su cometido.\\ncomo manos libres suenan excelente muy claros en todo aspecto ademas de contar con ENC el cual con la ayuda de sus microfonos elimina muy bien el ruido exterior al momento de estar en modo manos libres lo cual dicho ENC no hay que hacer nada al respecto, se activa de forma automatica en las llamadas.\\nel estuche de carga es algo grandecito por lo que no es facil llevarlo en la bolsa del pantalon o pants si andas haciendo ejercicio pero facil de trasportar en mochila o por ejemplo en una cangurera y tiene la capacidad de cargar tus auriculares alrededor de 3 veces mas una vez que agotas la bateria de los mismos la cual vamos a tocar de una vez, los auriculares prometen en promedio 10 horas de actividad pero ojo hay que ser cuidadosos en esto ya que a veces nosotros como usuarios no comprendemos como se mide esto, dichas 10 horas de servicio es a un volumen aproximadamente del 70% y con la conmutacion de LDAC apagada ya que todo ello hace que la bateria se gaste mas rapidamente pero si te gusta traer el volumen a todo lo que da y con LDAC encendido todo el tiempo pues el promedio de tiempo ronda las 6 o 6 y media horas el cual es bastante bueno la verdad como sea muy bien.\\ncuentan con un modo de baja latencia para cuando juegas el LAG sea casi imperceptible el cual funciona muy bien tambien y algo que me gusto mucho es que Truefree al ser una compañia hermana de SP pues debo comentar que la aplicacion movil de SP funciona perfectamente bien de hecho al momento de estarlos usando por primera vez me mando una actualizacion del firmware lo cual esta por demas excelente para asi siempre tenerlos actualizados como debe de ser.\\nen conclusion estamos ante un paquete bien completo la verdad; buen sonido (muy bueno de hecho), buen desempeño, buena autonomia, faciles de emparejar y muy comodos asi que si de verdad estas en busqueda de comprarte este par de auriculares para tus jornadas de ejercicio o simplemente de ocio al ir a caminar la verdad no lo dudes que los vas a disfrutar bastante.\\ngracias por llegar hasta aqui y espero te haya servido mi experiencia para si tenias alguna duda pues que haya sido resuelta, excelente dia y felices compras!!!', '', 'Zitten zo comfortabel dat mijn zoon en man ook een willen! Terwijl open oor is het geluid zeer goed en doet je oor geen pijn!', '', 'Adquirí estos auriculares con la intención de tener algo para usar en el gimnasio y también estar consciente del entorno al caminar o andar en bicicleta.\\nConseguí un pequeño descuento al comprarlos, así que pensé que los probaría para ver cómo funcionan. Sin embargo, esta reseña NO está sesgada por eso.\\nLos he tenido durante aproximadamente seis semanas y quería probarlos en todas las situaciones antes de dar una opinión.\\n\\nComodidad\\nSon súper cómodos, tanto que a veces olvido que los llevo puestos y puedo usarlos durante horas sin que me lastimen los oídos.\\nSon ideales para el gimnasio, ya que no se caen en absoluto, lo que significa que tampoco se caerán durante un trayecto.\\nPuedes escuchar la música claramente y todo lo que te rodea, lo cual es excelente desde el punto de vista de la seguridad.\\n\\nSonido\\nNo sabía qué esperar, ya que no son del tipo que va dentro del oído, pero el sonido es genial. Muy claro y no tan agudo como algunos otros que he probado en este rango de precio.\\nObviamente, no competirán con los muy caros.\\nLa única pequeña desventaja es que si el volumen está alto, la persona junto a ti podría escuchar lo que estás escuchando.\\n\\nLlamadas\\nAquí es donde se destacan aún más. Hice llamadas al extranjero mientras caminaba y la persona ni siquiera se dio cuenta de que estaba afuera; los micrófonos eran tan buenos y la cancelación de ruido también funcionó realmente bien.\\n\\nCarga\\nDuración prolongada, y solo los he cargado una vez en ese tiempo, y eso fue solo por si acaso.\\n\\nTambién se los di a mi pareja para que los probara, y antes de estos, ningunos auriculares le habían resultado cómodos, pero estos le encantaron por las mismas razones que mencioné anteriormente. ¡Podría necesitar comprar otro par!\\n\\nDefinitivamente los recomendaría si buscas comodidad con un sonido decente sin gastar una gran cantidad.', ''], 'detail': 'truefree O1 Open Ear Headphones Bluetooth 5.3 Wireless Open Ear Earbuds with 16.2mm Driver, Immersive Stereo Sound, Noise-Cancellation Mic for Clear Calls, 45H Playtime, for Sports Workout Gaming Open-ear Comfort & Aware Of Danger: The open-ear design of bluetooth headphones helps to achieve true painlessly and harmlessly.

At 20% the bluetooth starts cutting in and out on the microphone connection, which makes them unusable for meetings. You *can* switch to a wired connection, but (A) as far as I can tell the audio jack has no microphone connection, and (2) if you attempt to charge while using the audio jack to at least listen to things, there is a feedback buzz that occurs. I suppose I can at least switch to wired to listen to stuff while I'm working, but that means it's not charging, and I can't have meetings until it is charged... so... while these work great when they have power, I'm going to have to give this a low rating for actual usability for work purposes.\\n\\nUpdate: After 2 years of use, these are now refusing to stay connected to my PC, and I have no idea why. They stay connected to other stuff just fine, and other things seem to have no issue staying connected to my PC, but this headset just doesn't want to stay connected for some reason. For $140, I kind of expected them to be better, and last longer than they have.

That will probably sound weird, but they just feel a little lacklustre, somehow. In any case, husband has adopted those and loves them.\\n\\nWe needed a third pair for when batteries run low (we are both in headphones throughout the day every day) so we plumped for these - something for us to rotate to if and when we needed to recharge our respective old reliables.\\n\\nAnd they're marvellous! They're comfortable (although, just quickly, I have a smaller head than husband and I think I find them ever so slightly more comfy than he) and the sound quality is fab. The noise cancelling on them is genuinely cancel-y; it makes any external noises sound sort of tinny, and very far away. Marvellous.\\n\\nThere's a small robot lady that lives inside them that will tell you how your battery's getting on, too, and that's always fun.\\n\\nThe only downside is they don't come with a case, but they fit my Avantree case perfectly, so they have a home to go to.\\n\\nAll in all, I love them.

Great for tough gym sessions, noise cancelation is amazing, and it paired easily with my iPhone. Very comfortable and fits perfectly around the ear. Also, very long battery life compared to other ear buds I have purchased.\", \"I am someone who likes products that are good enough and don't understand how others are willing to pay $200 for a pair of headphones. I am also someone who doesn't want a junk product, just good enough quality at a good enough price. I bought these wireless earphones because I accidentally lost mine. Considering these earphones don't have the trusted brand of a name like Sony or Apple, it's always a bit of a gamble to buy a product that doesn't carry the peace of mind of a well-known big brand name, but it also doesn't carry the high price tag of one of those brands. I am writing this review because I am pleasantly surprised with the overall quality of these earphones. Both the sound quality and the build quality meet or exceed my expectations. The price makes it a great value find. The shape is comfortable for a 1-hour walk, no issues. Battery life seems normal to above normal. I've only had them for a few days but already find them to be better than my previous headphones that I lost. If they were to break or stop working prematurely, I will update this review. But if you're reading this now, that means they are still good.\", 'I have owned more than a dozen types of earbuds including two pairs of Apples. Being a woman, I have smaller ears and I’ve always had difficulty keeping them in my ears when on exercise equipment. These earbuds are so comfortable and stay put, give me amazing quality of sound, awesome noise canceling and the charge seems to last forever. They seem to connect instantly with my device unlike others that I’ve always had to pair up with every use. I’m thrilled, they will be the only ones I ever buy again! Best of all the price can’t be beat.', \"Sound quality is surprisingly good for the price. Plenty enough bass, but not too much where it takes over. Mids and highs have a good balance. The volume is plenty loud enough to use in noisy environments.\\nBut my favorite features are definitely the ear hooks and having physical buttons for the controls.\\nThese things stay put far better than the normal style earbuds when doing any kind of physical activity or even eating. And on the infrequent occasion when you do have to readjust these on your ears, you're not constantly accidentally pushing the oversensitive touch controls that most regular earbuds have these days. Starting to get tired of that.\\nBattery life is definitely awesome. Lasts a super long time. Far longer than any of my other sets of regular earbuds. I've had these for going on a month now and I'm just charging the case for the first time. Pretty amazing.\\nSo yeah, these are definitely worth the price. Hopefully they'll last a while.\", \"One thing I personally don't like about these nowadays is that there's no ear hook. These are so comfortable and you never have to worry about them falling off! I recommend these for great sound quality, comfortability, and compatibility for androids. Excellent product! The battery lasts absolutely forever so don't worry about that either!\", 'I purchased these earbuds because I lost the charging case for a much more expensive set of earbuds and resolved not to throw good money after bad in search of audiophile quality.\\n\\nPros: the fit of these earbuds is astoundingly good and the over-the-ear hooks are comfortable and better than my high priced buds. These two features alone make this a good purchase. I can comfortably work while wearing them without fear that they will dislodge, and the noise isolation is very good. The sound quality for podcasts is very good. Despite some other negative reviews about the controls, I actually like the physical controls on these buds and find them convenient to use, because I can feel the buttons on the earbuds. I don\\'t know how the battery will hold up, but in the short time that I have owned them the batteries in both the buds and the base have held a good charge.\\n\\nCons: Read the advertisement carefully: these earbuds do not have active noise-cancelling playback. I blame myself for not reading the advertisement better, and I do like the noise isolation that these earbuds provide, but I could not rate them highly as a \"noise cancelling\" device, at least for playback. The sound quality for music playback is acceptable, given the price point, but the bass gets a muddy fast and there\\'s detectable distortion at higher (but otherwise safe) volume.\\n\\nBottom line: a solid 4 stars and solid value for my purposes.', \"LOVE THESE BUDS.. my husband is ill so I have buds in from the time I get up till the time i go to bed.. the battery last all day and then I charge them before bed... the FIT IS AWSOME.. they are not stiff.. very flexible..the sound is great.. compared to the last pair I had I actually had to turn volume down because these buds didn't need to be up that far for good sound...\\nthe price was surprising for how these buds perform!! awesome!!\", 'I bought these earbuds to use while traveling and found them to be a very good value and easy to use. Well, not supposed to be sound blocking, I did find them very helpful in blocking noise while flying. I like the feature on the case that shows you the battery life. I recommend them highly.', \"Très bien ! Le son est pas incroyable mais bon , on peut pas s'attendre à mieux à ce prix.\\nTrès bon maintient .\\nPetit bémol pour la boîte qui est super glissante Oo\", '', 'Lo mejores auriculares Bluetooth aparte de el sonido genial y muy fuerte batería dura mucho , son cómodas y no hay problemas de emparejar como en otras ni si vais a sacar una por una', '', 'Ich habe die BX29 als Ersatz für meine verschwundenen JBL Wave 100 Buds gekauft. Ich nutze die Kopfhörer hauptsächlich für Hörbücher und zum Telefonieren und für diesen Zweck sind Sie auf jeden Fall top geeignet. Im Vergleich zu den JBL ist die Sprache natürlicher und für mich dadurch besser zu verstehen. Bei Music ist der Bass wenn man die passende Größe Stöpsel verwendet sehr gut, ich verwende jedoch eine Nummer kleiner um besser die Umwelt um mich herum beim Laufen hören zu können, mit den kleineren Stöpseln finde ich die Earbuds auch angenehmer zu tragen. Die JBL (Model ohne Bügel) mußte ich immer ganz fest ins Ohr drücken damit sie hielten, die BX29 sitzen dank dem Bügel auch ohne Druck sehr angenehm und fallen auch nicht heraus. Wobei die Bügel auch nicht wie bei anderen Bluetooth Headsets die ich schon hatte mit der Brille um den korrekten Sitz konkurieren. Ich hatte zwischendurch \"günstige\" in-ears beim Discounter gekauft, diese waren jedoch für mich praktisch nicht zu gebrauchen.\\nPositiv ist mir außerdem das automatische pairing bei der Entnahme aus der Ladeschale aufgefallen, welches zu den am besten funktionierenden gehört die ich bisher benutzt habe, meine großen Over-Ear ANC Kopfhören könnten sich da eine Scheibe von abschneiden.\\nAppropos Noise Canceling: die BX29 haben nur ENC, kein ANC, wer wirklich auf das Noise Canceling angewiesen ist sollte lieber in große Over-Ear Kopfhörer mit guten ANC investieren.\\nIch hatte die BX29 extra als ein günstigeres In-Ear Model ausgesucht für dne Fall das diese auch verlohren gehen, würde diese aber auch ansonsten als in-ears jetzt wieder kaufen. Die JBL hatten das doppelte gekostet, eine schlechtere Sprachverständlichkeit und wesentlich schlechtere Reichweite in der Wohnung.\\nJe nach Anwendung habe ich auch noch mehrere andere Kopfhörer im Einsatz, aber als kleine, günstige, portable in-ears sind die BX29 wirklich zu empfehlen.', '', \"I have had wireless ear buds before, and normally I lose them (they fall out) before they break. These have a useful over-the-ear hook that is very comfortable and ensures they don't fall out. I have health issues that means I can fall over when my legs give way. I use crutches, but when I fall, my main concern is trying not to get hurt, so concern for my ear buds is far from my mind. So far, I have fallen over a number of times while using these ear buds and not once have they fallen off my ears. I would imagine they would be great for runners or for use during gym workouts for the same reason - they don't fall out.\\n\\nThe battery life has not caused me any concerns. I tend to use them for between 2 to 6 hours at most though. Each time I stop using them they go back in their charging case. I charge the case every few days - not because it is out of power, but just to keep it topped up.\\n\\nSound quality for me is perfectly fine. I tend to listen to BBC Sounds or to Audible audiobooks. I am not an audiophile - these are more than good enough for me.\\n\\nUsing for making phone calls - I have had no real complaints from people on the other end of a call. I have often used them to make calls from a car or when outside, even in windy weather. Although once when I was out in extremely windy and wet weather the other person did say they had trouble hearing me - which is understandable.\\n\\nThe control buttons, as with all such ear buds, do take a little getting used to as not all devices use the same sequence of short or long taps to do the same things. However, they do work pretty well. The basics or volume up / down and pause/play work great - I tend to do other things on the phone rather than try to remember the exact button press method for more complicated functions.\\n\\nThe best feature to me at least - and remember, I'm not an audiophile - is that you can wear both buds, but turn one off. This means you can double the length of time you can use the earbuds between recharging - as long as you only use one at a time. It also allows you to have one ear free to listen to your surroundings / other people. For listening to audiobooks or music while out and about this works well for me. When one goes flat (only happened once on a long day out), you simply turn the other bud on, and carry on. It means I don't need to carry the charging case with me on a day trip.\\n\\nI've only had them for a few weeks, so I can't comment on how long they will last - only time will tell. As long as they last more than 12 months, I'll likely replace them when they fail with the same ones, or possibly their successor.\\n\\nIn summary, they meet all my requirements and I'm very happy with them.\", 'I finally bought these earbuds after years of considering and I am so glad I did! I was previously put off by the short battery life of such products and also because I wanted to use them with an iPhone and have found that Apple earphones are too large to fit my relatively small ears. (I have ended up buying childrens’ earphones and then putting the smallest foam tip on the ends and they still feel a bit too big). So when I saw that these came with several different sizes of ear pieces, were small in the first place and also had a good long battery life I decided to try some, and I’m so pleased I did! They fit nicely into my ears and the curly part makes sure they stay in place so you don’t have to force them into your ears to make them stay! I use them in the car and find I can hear the person I am speaking to far more clearly than when I was running my phone through the car’s audio system, and they have a similar experience. I assume this is because of the noise cancelling function. The battery has not run out on me yet and the little charging case is really neat. Altogether I really am thrilled with these and would highly recommend them.

Great volume, they do leak a little but that's at high volume. Great with taking calls, they're fine in the rain, comfortable for long use, ive even worn them to bed and will lay on them.1000% worth the money and as my first pair of headphones i cant believe I've gone this long without a pair.\\n\\nI don't really use them for the noise canceling feature, however i have used the feature and id say they work good for that. It's like sticking a conch to your ear, completely blocks out background noise like fans and does a good job muffling more concentrated sounds like talking or construction\\n\\nThe only thing that is negative is they are a little big, so while they have great extensions, I'd recommend a little caution if you have a small head. Also the pause and play button, while great with music and youtube, is a little finicky with streaming sites (hulu, netflix etc)\", \"I bought these, hoping for a better outcome than I have had in the past with beats.

I love how aesthetically pleasing they are and add a little touch to your outfits. only disadvantage is, they sound leak and they smell weird when they’re first unpackaged. but the smell goes away after a few wears. overall tho 8.5/10 on these headphones.', 'So I wanted to wait and test them out for a while before I did a review. Had the headphones for over a month now and I love them! Very lightweight, the battery life is amazing, I don’t always use them so I didn’t have to charge them yet but the battery is at 80 I believe and that’s great! The only complaints i have is the sound leakage and noise cancellation. The sound does leak a bit but I don’t mind that. Noise cancellation has a weird sound but that’s only when you’re not listening to something, so i’m not sure if that’s common for noise cancellation or not. If you’re not a big fan on sound leak and the weird noise then probably not for you. Other than that, great headphones for the price!', '', '', 'I wanted a cute pair of headphones but I didn’t want to spend a lot of money. The style and color of these is really nice (I ordered silver) and I like how you can twist the ear pieces. However the sound leakage is horrific it’s pointless to even wear them because everyone around you can hear it too which defeats the purpose for me as I don’t really like people hearing what I’m listening to in public spaces. The video I posted I would say my volume was about 50% and some people may think that sound leakage is fine but it’s by biggest pet peeve with headphones. I was testing how loud I could put my music before others could hear it and I’d say I only got to about 25% volume on my iPhone before it was noticeable. So for me, a person who likes to listen to her music loud, this was a major no go so I am returning it and will probably just cave and get a nicer pair. I would say the quality of materials is probably comparable to the price although the plastic can look a little cheap up close but that didn’t bother me because I really liked the style. Sound and bass was good, noise cancellation is pretty good I guess nothing crazy. Bluetooth connecting was a little weird as well and I worry it may be an issue in the future. Sound leakage was a major dealbreaker for me tho.

I have a fairly large head and they adjust to fit perfectly. They are very light and comfortable. The battery life is amazing. I usually listen an hour or two a day and only have to charge them every few weeks. I think the sound quality is good, but I am usually listening to audiobooks--so I'm not sure that is the best test for sound quality. There isn't active noise canceling, but the over-the-ear cups do a good job of blocking out outside noise. I've taken some phone calls while I'm wearing them and it's easy to hear the phone and easy for the person I'm talking to to hear me. I would recommend these headphones!\", \"The battery lasts forever, they're crazy comfortable, the bluetooth connection is super easy, they sound great (though I'm not an expert in this area), and there's no active noise cancelling! I'm one of those people who finds noise cancelling makes me feel pressure in my ears, but good luck finding bluetooth over ear headphones without that feature! The best thing about these is how comfortable they are. I'd returned a few pairs already and was considering buying one of the super expensive noise cancelling headsets (which allow you to turn the noise cancelling off) just to get something that wouldn't squish my ears and head (both of which are on the large side). But these are perfect! And affordable! I was skeptical that the battery life would be good at this price but it is truly excellent. Only thing I don't love is how long you have to long press the button to turn them on and off (a long time), but that's just something to get used to.\", \"What They Are: Lightweight, Stylish, and Comfy!\\n\\nWhat They’re Not: Noise Cancelling\\n\\nThese headphones offer solid performance at an affordable price point. While they may not deliver anything extraordinary, it's unrealistic to expect that from a pair of headphones priced below a couple hundred dollars. The overall quality is decent, and the sound output is satisfactory. However, it's worth noting that external noises are only partially muffled, so complete sound isolation from your surroundings isn't achieved.\\n\\nOne noticeable drawback is that the sound occasionally pauses for a moment when switching between apps on your phone, which can be a bit annoying. Nevertheless, considering their price range, these headphones are on par with other options available in the $30-$50 range.\\n\\nIn conclusion, if you're seeking a budget-friendly pair of headphones that offer decent audio quality without breaking the bank, these headphones are a reasonable choice. Just keep in mind the minor inconvenience of sound pauses during app switching.\", \"They're comfortable and last all week with their battery life. Good value for the price and they look nice. The low end of the sound isn't super strong, so may not be the right headphone for you if you're looking for it. The app it comes with its also not very helpful and ended up not using it at all since I couldn't adjust the eq.\", \"They sound great. Battery lasts a long time. Very comfortable. Good range. I use them for work calls and everyone reports the mic quality is good. I'm kind of amazed you can get something this good for this less than $50. Replaced airpods pro and don't regret it.\", 'Quality through out', \"for the price, these are so much better than i thought they would be! sound quality isn't the best, but it gets the job done. battery life is incredible!! used these for a 10 hour car ride and the battery only went down 15-20%! doesn't completely block out outside noise, but muffles it very well. would definitely recommend these!\", \"These are my first pair of Bluetooth headphones, and I'd say they're alright. I've been wanting to get a pair of Bluetooth headphones for awhile now and finally settled on these ones.\\nAs someone who's never been too concerned with top tier sound quality these are good for the price. It did take me a few days to get used to the sound, but now they're good and the quality doesn't bother me at all. The app you can download and connect these to is alright but it doesn't offer a lot of choices.\\nThese are SUPER comfy. As someone who wears glasses, I haven't had a problem with the stems digging into my head at all which is really nice. The cups go all the way over your ears and they fit near perfectly for me.\\nThe battery life is really good too. They were at 74% out of the box and I've been using them constantly for a few days now, sometimes accidently leaving them on overnight, and they're only down to 62%.\\nI have had an occasional problem where it glitches out occasionally but disconnecting and then reconnecting fixes that problem. There is some slight hissing occasionally but it doesnt happen often so it doesn't really annoy me. There is quite a bit of sound bleed however. If you have you're volume turned up over halfway you're gonna hear some bleed. It's not a ton, but it's enough to hear from a few feet away.\", 'Estou usando há alguns meses e simplesmente amei o fone. O isolamento de ruído não é super eficiente mas ajuda bastante. É muito confortável e o som é muito bom. A bateria dura bastante! não uso todo os dias, e nem por muito tempo. mas desde que comprei só carreguei 2 vezes. Ahh ele não dobra. Mas recomendo bastante!', '', 'La verdad suenan excelente, solo que en ocasiones tienen interferencia (con apagarlos y reiniciar el bt del receptor queda).\\nPor el precio me parecen una muy buena opción.', '', \"Ho sempre e solo avuto cuffie a filo, dalla Koss porta pro in poi. Ho letto le recensioni molto positive per queste cuffie qua, e mi sono deciso di comprarle. Sinceramente non mi aspettavo grandi cose. Anche dal punto di vista della comodità, perché io ho un bel testone e non è facile trovare delle cuffie a padiglione chiuso che mi stiano bene. Devo dire che dovevo comprarle prima. A livello ergonomico sono perfette con un design che non avevo mai visto prima ,leggermente inclinato rispetto ai padiglioni, è sono di una comodità\\nunica. Isolano bene dal resto dell'ambiente. La resa acustica è ottima. Con alcune applicazioni è sbilanciata verso i bassi che qualche volta prendono il sopravvento, però basta agire con un semplice equalizzatore e le cose tornano a posto. Per adesso usate circa tre ore, con grande gusto, batteria ancora all'84%. Non posso fare confronti diretti perché prima di queste non avevo mai comperato cuffie bluetooth. Ma a questo prezzo sono soldi ben spesi.\", '', 'Très bon son', '', 'Le compré estos auriculares a mi mujer y está muy contenta. Yo mismo los he probado y puedo decir que son ligeros, cómodos y aunque no tienen cancelación de ruido activa, los auriculares aíslan bastante bien de forma pasiva. El sonido es correcto y puede funcionar con batería vía bluetooth. La duración de la batería anuncia 40 horas, no lo he comprobado. Pero más de 20h si que aguantan. Sonido en llamadas y micrófono que cumple su función en exterior paseando en ciudad. Además si te quedas sin batería siempre puedes usarlo con un Jack 3,5 de toda la vida, como unos cascos normales. No he notado diferencia de sonido escuchando música vía bluetooth o cable. Pero seguramente es debido a que la música la escuchaba de YouTube, donde la calidad de sonido ya viene limitada de por sí. En algún momento me bajaré algún álbum versión CD y compararé mejor. Después de probarlos, me he quedado con las ganas de comprar y ver cómo serán los 820 nb plus. Ahora en oferta por black friday.

They're not sennheisers or beyerdynamics, but they definitely hold their own to headphones in their price range.

But with having the right equalizer. These blow the expensive brands out of the water! Which makes this an excellent buy for the price!\\n\\nAll I have is nice things to say about these ear buds.\\n\\nSnug fit, low profile, fast pairing, very light, great bass and tone, no propitiatory app, great build quality and nice case.\\n\\nI hope you enjoy these as much as I do!\", 'I did not expect this to be as good as I found it to be. They come in a charging case, and it includes different sized ear buds for a custom fit. They came half charged and I used them right away. Easy to pair with Bluetooth on my phone. Clear sound. High quality, snug but comfortable fit for running. So far, so good!', 'Admittedly I tried to get these wireless earbuds on my ear and couldn’t. Yes I am a dufus! So I asked my generation Z son and he said figure it out yourself 🤣 So I left them on the table and wouldn’t you know the following morning, the smartest person in the house, my wife, had them on her ears and showed me how to put them on. Easy! Pairing was easy. Charging is easy. Sound is great. After years of the economical $20 wired Apple EarPods always dying within 6 months and then upgrading to the more expensive wireless $160 wireless Airpods only to see two fail within a year… I was at wits end. I hike a lot and need the music and podcasts so out of desperation I took one my kid’s older beats headphones which made me look like an old man! Alas, I scrolled Amazon and found these wireless earbuds… price seemed too good to be true but the reviews were really good. I decided to give them a try and after several days of use… decided to keep them. So far so good, and the sound is better then I expected. Two thumbs up.', '', '', \"The buds arrived on time and nearly 100% charged. I love that they came 4 sizes of ear tips as well as a charging cable. Several buds I've purchased in the past (sometimes for more than I did these) included neither.\\n\\nI'm very pleased with the sound quality as well as the power of the bass. These babies fit perfectly while I'm working out. Highly sweat resistant and hold their position under high movement. Due to the size of the ear cuff, I would only recommend these for adults as I tried them on my 8 year old and they did fit as comfortably on her.\\n\\nOver all these are a very good quality bud for the cost, and I would highly recommend them for anyone with an active or athletic lifestyle as well as those whonsimply want a comfortable ear piece to enjoy some music or a hands free call. I look forward to using these both at the gym as well as during my down time when I'm reading.\", 'Great fit and sound! The X19 earbuds sit eell and are very secure. The sound quality is awesome both with music and calls. The microphone picks up well with only a bit of background noise. The buttons are easy to find and use.', 'Great sound, easy to connect, easy to use with accessible buttons, comfortable wear', 'These earbuds are absolutely wonderful. They are lightweight, secure, clear and easy to use. The battery life is perfect for my needs. The reviews were on point. They are so comfortable you can forget you have them on. Great product!!', \"Nice earbuds, good sound and volume, the battery lasts a long time for my usage, and the case has a nice battery life readout.

I waited a couple months to write review because I wanted to really put these buds to the test. These are my go to ear buds. I like them better than my Gallaxy buds! They are so comfortable and the battery life is amazing. I use theough entire workday without needing to charge. You can still hear everything going on around you, so these buds are amazing for work, if you need to be able to respond to others or the phone. Also, they won't fall off, even when running, bending, etc. Not for use in a super noisy area as they do not block hearing ambient sounds; however, the microphone does block background noise in calls. I am so happy that I purchased these buds! I use them daily.\", 'I have gone through numerous earbuds over the years. Inevitably, they all lose sound out of one or the other. That could be because in getting tangled around me, I may pull the wiring from one bud loose eventually. Serious problem for me, as I am always listening to an audiobook. I’ve been wanting to get wireless, but I have always been afraid that they would fall out of my ears. I already have enough trouble with the earbud causing pain after a short period of time. I have small ear, canals, and the earbud, even with the smallest attachment, can be problematic.\\n\\nBecause I usually only have listened with one in, because I like to be aware of what’s going on around me, I had looked into the open air version. Almost all of them seem to hook over the outer ear, in a way that would completely interfere with my glasses.\\n\\nI didn’t know what to expect from these. They look very strange, but I thought I’d give them a try. I am so very glad I did! They hook onto the ear very lightly but securely. I know they’re there, but they’re not heavy, and they don’t bother me . There’s nothing to go into the ear canal, so that is no longer a problem, no more pain. With the open ear, I can have both in, and still be able to hear what’s going on around me, which is a huge plus for me. The volume has been excellent. The only time that’s been a problem is when I’m on a very loud bus, with too much motor noise around me. That’s happened once out of all the times I’ve worn them.\\n\\nThe battery life seems excellent. Once they’re in the case, they no longer connect to the phone, so they are no longer connected to the Bluetooth for the playback. I need to make sure that I turn off play, before I take them out and pop them on, if I don’t wanna miss a word, lol. They do automatically connect as soon as they come out of the case. Once they’re in the case, they are also charging. You do need to be aware of the case having enough charge on it, and recharging that, because it can’t charge the earbuds if it’s not charged , lol. The controls seem fairly easy, but I have issues with dexterity and sensation in my fingers, so I still have to poke around to find the on-off, but that’s my own problem and I’m sure I’ll learn it eventually.\\n\\nThe only possible problem with these, if you are so, inclined, would be using them for phone calls. It’s been spotty, some people don’t complain, or simply say that it sounds like I’m in a tunnel. Others have said they can’t understand anything. That may be because they are the open air conduction rather than the bone conducting. I was not comfortable with the ones that do the bone conduction for the sound, and I don’t make enough phone calls that I need these for, overall. I’ve had some long conversations with people who have not had any trouble dealing with any “distortion“ in how well, my voice transmits.\\n\\nExtremely happy with this purchase!', \"I hesitated with purchasing these because of the reviews saying that the sound quality was poor. The sound is fine. All you have to do is slide them down your ear and the sound will get higher. If the earpiece is up high on your ear, the sound is lower. The sound is not as good as my Samsung ear buds but they get the job done and saves my ears from hurting. I use earpieces to listen to audiobooks most of the time but I've received calls as well and haven't had any trouble hearing the caller. They fit my girly ears just fine and the battery life is OUTSTANDING. They last all day and I rarely put them back into the charging case until bedtime. I would definitely recommend these. They are comfortable and cool looking.\", 'The good.\\nSound quality is good, the fit is great, battery life is average about 4 hours.\\nThe bad\\nWould connect randomly when not in use, would independently play different sounds.\\nOne headphone would die and hour before the other.\\n\\nOverall I would give these a 3. The ok ok for the price if you use the coupon, but need work', 'Maintain situational awareness, I use them in my classroom and when in the hospital. Makes it easy to still monitor my students as you can still easily hear them and easy to maintain awareness of what is going on especially in a hospital room so you are not surprised when a nurse or doctor walked in. I find them very comfortable (the design is great for those of us who where glasses as they do not loop over the ear) and good sound quality for what they are. Do not expect the high quality of a set of Shure earbuds, but the quality is good for what the are and the price you are paying for them. Remember to compare apples to apples (headphones of the same type and price range) there is no comparison to a pair of Shure Aonics but they are not in the same class, price range, or even type. But then again that is a comparison of apples to alligators. For what they are I love them, and use them frequently. Also they are comfortable and can be used individually, they also fit in the “wrong” ear comfortably. I prefer to have them only one in my right ear while I am teaching to keep in contact with colleagues.', \"I don't know this brand and its product, but based on previous reviews and product info I know, I gave a try and immediately notice the difference compared with other air earbuds. The main advantage is its unique egernomic design that won't put on weight on the ear top where usually that's prone to accumulate dirts, oils, and sweats. Secondly, it holds prety steadily but not pinchy so you won't feel it at all long time. I purchased this for my mom so she can wear at home all day enjoying the musics but never worry about missing phone calls or door bells. Third, the batteries of both earbuds and its host can last a few days without charging. I think as long as we are not really getting into the doomsday, battery is the least what you should concern. Bottom line, it does exactly what it's advertised, lgiht weight, no nonsense, easy to control, clear audio quality, free shipping and return, what more do I expect from 20$?! I don't understand why people complain its bass quality and noise isolation. It's like complaining Tesla can't take gasoline.\"], 'detail': \"Sanag Earring Wireless Earbuds Bluetooth 5.3 with Microphone Open Ear Clip On Headphones with Charging Case Compatible with iPhone/Samsung Phone for Men,Women - White Secure fit: The elastic clip earring design ensures a secure fit, making them suitable for various activities like running, cycling, and sports.\\nStylish and Versatile: Available in different colors, this clip on headphones are designed to be fashionable for all, including men, women.\\nSafe and Comfortable: These headphones use air conduction technology that doesn't enter the ear and doesn't harm the ear after extended use.

They probably shouldn\\'t be the only pair of headphones you own and use. These are ideal for exercise (since they can handle sweat) or anywhere they might get hit with drops of rain or sand. You can even use them in the bathtub without worry of splashing on them (unlike most other over-ear sets), but be very careful not to submerge or drop them in the water.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t need the water resistance, you can find better audio quality and comfort. For home listening, I\\'d suggest springing a bit more for a comfortable open-back headset set, and for casual listening outside the house, high quality earbuds (which I\\'d also suggest springing a bit more for) are still ideal. However, my problem with earbuds is that when exercising, my ear canals tend to tighten up and they become extremely uncomfortable. This set is built to stay on your head while exercising, so it can feel a bit tight after a couple hours, but the earpads have a soft \"cooling gel\" that is better than other sets I\\'ve used, and it definitely gets more comfortable after a short break-in period. As an added bonus, the pads are removable and the outer lining is washable (although they feel pretty durable, I\\'m curious to see how long they last). The headband has a strip of rubber to soften the pressure, but it does feel a bit too hard and some comfort improvements could be made there. On the other hand, it feels built like a tank - they\\'re light on your head, but still feel extremely durable. Other bonuses include a standard audio jack as an option instead of Bluetooth, big sturdy volume control buttons that aren\\'t a pain to use like most headset controls, and an insane battery that lasts ages (I got at least the manufacturer spec of 35 hours, using them 2-3 hours a day for nearly two weeks without needing to recharge).\\n\\nThese weren\\'t the first pair of water-resistant cans I bought from Phillips. The previous version was the SH402, which I bought based on goodwill coming from their excellent X2 headphones I\\'ve used for years. These were an absolute travesty, with buzzing out of one side and audio quality that sounded like somebody playing music under a couch in the next room with the door closed, and I\\'d never returned something so fast. The A4216 set VASTLY improves on these, with very good audio quality. It\\'s still not top-tier in the pure audio department or anything - it\\'s a bit overly bassy with a hint of a muffled quality in the way a lot of closed-back headsets that are built to prevent audio leakage are - but it\\'s more than good enough as a minor compromise to balance out the other benefits this set has (especially for the reasonable price), and again, if you don\\'t need an exercise/water-resistant headset, you\\'d probably want to look elsewhere anyway. If you happen to be in that particular market though, I\\'m not sure you can really do much better than these.', \"I want to start by saying that the audio quality on these is exactly what you'd expect from headphones under $100. The lows are a little muddled and the bass is lacking, but other than that they have generally decent audio quality. I'm able to listen to all of my favorite songs without feeling like anything is seriously lacking, but I definitely won't use these for any studio work.\\n\\nThat said: holy crap I don't think these are capable of running out of battery. I've been using them at the gym 5 days a week for about an 1.5 hours and they just... don't die? They advertise 30 hour battery life but I'm at about 2 months of continuous use and I JUST plugged them in for the first time. Not even because they died, but because I had the reasonable human impulse to plug them in after 2 months of not doing so. I'm not sure if these headphones have the capability to harness power from the sun or from God herself or what.\\n\\nI would normally give headphone like these about a 3 or so out of 5, but the battery life alone adds another star. Not to mention the price being so low... These headphones are honestly great. I still prefer my AT ATH-M50xBTGM wireless headphones when I'm at home because the quality is superior (they were also $200, to be fair) but this particular pair of philips headphones comes with me everywhere I go simply for the sheer utility of them. It's almost a 100% guarantee that they will have enough charge for whatever I'm doing that day.\\n\\nBased on the price point, battery life and overall quality, these get a 4.5 from me. Rounding to a 5 because Amazon.\", \"I have had these for about a week. I was looking for a headset I could use for home office with audio, but could also be used for walks outdoors. I ordered one prior to this and they made my ears sweat, and were not so comfortable due to how large and plasticy feel the ear cushion was despite it's decent reviews, but they KEPT disconnecting from my lap top off and on mid calls, which was a FAIL... so I returned them and then ordered these.\\nPROS:\\nThey are very sturdy, don't feel cheap at all.\\nThe sound quality (my oppinion) is GREAT - deep base, but sound is clear, and decent, loud enough.\\nFit snug I suppose if you will workout, run, they should stay put.\\nThe ear peice is like a soft mesh which I like better than some fake leather/rubber type ones that make your ear sweat.\\nThey have NOT disconnected ONCE from my laptop and I use them all day.\\nCons:\\nThey are a bit tight, which is good I guess if you will run/jog...but I think moving forward I will get ON ear vs over the ear, because they put pressure (not ALOT) enough where I just don't LOVE it.\\nWhile the sound QUALITY is very good, they don't get very loud, but it's like the perfect amount, not too loud not too soft I suppose. I HAVE Not hooked them to my phone yet so they might be different there.\\nThere is a little rubber peice that covers the charge hole, my last set just had a slot, I am quite sure this will break off eventually.\\nI have not tried to see if I can connect to 2 things - phone and computer, like go between the 2.\\nI think won't I really don't like is the HEAD cusion - quite frankly it sucks. It is not even a cushion, more of a semi soft extra layer of rubber. My last set (Sol Republic) were SOOOOO soft at the top like a pillow of cussion and the PERFECT ear fit, not too much not too little and super soft I barely noticed them HOWEVER they were not a tight fit and would move sometimes when running - why didn't I get their latest model? they were like $160 but I probably will next time. It last me like 4 years! LOL :)\\n- and final con, is lately people are like what? I cannot really hear you - but the volume is on full volume..that doesn't happen each call..so we shall see.\\nIF you just want for SALES or home office, maybe a headset for that is better suited. BUT I wanted to be able to use it for that AND outdoors, so I opted for this. :)\\nHope that helps.\", 'A mí esposa le encantaron, me dijo que la batería le dura bastante, le gustan porque puede hacer ejercicio con ellos sin riesgo a qué se deterioren por el sudor o la humedad\\ny está encantada con el sonido de los mismos 👍🏼.', '', 'Noise cancellation is okay and total output is also ok.

There’s plenty reasons why these headphones are still on everyone list for “most bang for your buck”. These and their little brother,the Soundcore Q20+, are some of the best value in headphones. Between durability,sound quality, ANC,fit and portability they are a solid buy everytime and a good introduction to entry level ANC headphones. Battery life incredible too', 'I love these headphones, they last a super long time, come with a nice travel bag, and cover the ears without sitting on them. Noise cancelling is so good it annoys my boyfriend because I can’t hear him when he tries talks to me 😂 I kind of wish they folded up nicer (they’re still a little bulky if trying to pack them in a bag) but overall really nice headphones and the price is amazing for the quality.', 'These are pretty decent headphones for the price ($35). Comfortable too. Noise Cancelling is OK. I don’t know much about NC, but the best way to describe it is you can still hear a loud door knock, just not the echoes following it. Highly recommend if you only use Bluetooth mode. AUX mode is where its weakness lies. Particularly AUX with NC turned on.\\n\\nAUX wired mode is noticeably lower quality than Bluetooth wireless mode, but still ok quality for watching movies (though sub-average for music). HOWEVER, the biggest con which ultimately made me return these is when turning on noise cancelling while in AUX mode (necessary on planes) — there is a continuous static noise that accompanies whatever your watching/listening to unless you drown it out with high volume. However, even when drowned out, I feel the static noise still makes my ears/head ache after prolonged use. Since I got these mainly for using on the plane (AUX+NC MODE) and they do not work well in that mode, I will be returning them. Such a shame. Almost perfect for my needs.', 'i could rave about these for HOURS - i love these so much i bought a pair for me & my eldest daughter (19)\\n\\nnoise cancellation - the nosie cancellation is perfect, you can tell the distinct difference between it being on & off, & even when off the sound is still sealed off to fit your ear & give you the best sound experience.\\n\\nganingn & streaming - this headset is so well my daughter replaced her razer pink kitty headset with these for better gaming audio, better streaming audio, & for better music - perfect for streamers !\\n\\nbattery life - you could leave these on for a few hours using them or not, & they would still be full battery. we forget to charge them all the time whether we’re using them constantly or if we just put them off to the side for a few days to even a few weeks, they manage to hold an AMAZING charge. i don’t think i’ve ever had them actually die on me, most it’s gone to is medium battery !! theyere battery preserving !\\n\\nmusic - gives out the best bass, no need to have them to loud in case it give you a headache, but is perfect for mellow music, loud music, & asmr. feels very immersive, & even does the effect of being able to only hear out of one headset & the other - super cool !\\n\\ngaming - can hear smaller detailings (ex: knocking in a horror game) & really sucks you into the game truly, feels like it has its own surround sound\\n\\ncomfort - if your sensitive to things squishing your head or easily prone to headaches, i would recommend only wearing these for shorter periods of times. my daughter wears it on her long walks (typically 1-4 hours a day) & comes back with headaches from having them on to long. as well as fitted glasses, be weary because they will squish your glasses in your head a bit, & cause headaches. besides that, they’re very comfortable on the ears with the padding, & the band tracts & retracts to fit your head shape & comfort !\\n\\nlook - sleek & beautiful, fits a good aesthetic if you want an alternative to the expensive sony or gaming headphones. would look cute with add on cat ears or others accessories as such, or stickers ! even blank they look very aesthetically pleasing\\n\\noverall, these headphones i love, & my daughter can attest that she never leaves the house without them, & her person.\\n\\nperfect for anyone who wants to concentrate, listen to music in a tasteful way, read, game, write, & feel concentrated & immersed into it, perfect for trips or walks - the possibilities are endless !!', 'Bought these for the gym as I wanted over the ear headphones but didn’t want to break the bank on some that are going to get sweaty all the time. Sound quality is a crisp 7.5/10 and the bass is pretty decent, a cool feature is that you are able to turn on/off the noise canceling option with a physical button on the headphones, cushioning on it feels great and is easily cleanable with disinfecting wipes or such. Battery life is great on them as well I go 3 days with one charge typically 2-2 1/2 hrs a day. I also did try them for gaming when I first got them and they were great in game, I was able to hear footsteps all around with no problems you can use the Bluetooth option but there is a wire included which I suggest you use, the mic also sound pretty decent at my score of an 7/10 but for the price I think these are definitely worth it as I’ve bought myself another pair as backup and also have gotten some for my niece and she loves them.', 'Fantastic sound and airplane and ambient noise canceling. Charge lasts very long time. Refurbished version now ships with more common USB micro charging socket, not USB mini socket. Easy control system.', 'For the amount of money it cost this product is amazing. Sound quality and comfort are are above my expectations!! I will buy again as a gift', \"First use was in a Southwest airplane, very noticeable when I put them on, when I lifted them off during the flight I couldn't believe how loud the noise became.\", \"I bought these for use as part of an assisted listening system at our church. The room is fairly live, and the HVAC system is quite loud, so lots of reverb and white noise most of the time. The quality of construction on these is actually quite impressive for the price. The headphones are very comfortable for the 2 or so hours they are used each week, and the controls are easy to use. The sound quality is actually very good (especially for our intended use). As a musician and sound tech, I value clarity and a balanced frequency response, and these perform very well.\\n\\nWhat surprised me the most was the quality of the Active Noise Cancellation (ANC). They compare really well with my Bose Q35's, which are about 5x the price. The white noise of the HVAC and bad reverb of our room are completely cancelled out, which I didn't expect to happen with a sub-$100 headphone.\\n\\nIf you are a snobby audiophile who demands the most accurate sound possible, you are likely going to spend 10x as much on headphones that can only give marginally better performance than these do. If you are someone who wants to enjoy good quality sound with excellent ANC at a really good price, I highly recommend these headphones.\", 'I got these so I could watch programmes on my laptop without disturbing other family members, and they have become one of my favourite possessions very quickly! They are incredible. They block the sound to others, and at the same time your own sound is rich and immersive. The charge lasts a very long time too so you don’t have to worry about it on long trips.\\nI love them!

I want to hear all the details in a piece of recorded music and want background parts at the right sound level in relation to the other instruments/vocals in a song. These headphones have AMAZING sound--not for $20--just amazing sound in their own right. I read a review that said they have better sound quality than a $120 pair of headphones, and I couldn\\'t agree more. Sound is rich and full. Can hear all layers of all types of music. Bass is very impressive as are the highs, but what truly impressed me, and which I have found lacking in two other sets of headphones I recently ordered, is the quality of the mid-range sounds.\\n\\nThe headphones are incredibly light-feeling on your head and the ear pads are soft and very, very comfortable. The long cord is absolutely no problem and looks and feels substantive, unlike some other cheap, very thin cords. They are excellent at outside sound dampening. I researched so many headphones for hours and bought a pair of JVC HAV-570 \"Super Bass\" headphones. Admittedly, they were only $13, but they had many of the same specs as the X500\\'s, i.e., 40mm drivers, etc, but the sound on the X500\\'S is literally five times better, and this saying a lot, because I was mildly satisfied with the cheaper pair (which got four stars overall on Amazon). However, wanting more, I purchased a pair of Audio-Technica ATH-M30 Professional Headphones through Amazon for $40. They lacked range and were tight and felt smothering when worn. They don\\'t come close to the JVC X500 in sound quality. I returned them and was going to settle for the other JVC\\'s until I saw these on Amazon).\\n\\nI am not an expert at describing what makes for high sound quality but I know that when someone says, when describing headphones, that they hear parts of songs they couldn\\'t previously hear well with other headphones, that means something, if accurate. That description is absolutely true with these headphones. It\\'s not so much you will hear sounds that you never heard at all, it is that you will hear instrumental parts and vocals (such as some back up vocals), much clearer and stronger than you hear them with other headphones. I must re-emphasize that the sound from these headphones is incredibly rich and full, especially if your system has a graphic equalizer that you can admust to your particular likes. You cannot go wrong with these headphones!! I am almost in disbelief that they cost only $18, seem solidly made, are extremely comfortable and the sound will impress you to no end. They are heaven!', \"I run a podcast and I was searching for an affordable solution that provided three key factors: Comfort, Clarity, and Compactness. The comfort factor was the most important because if you are going to have a few of your guests wearing these for an hour, they need to feel like nothing is there. Clarity for the quality of the sound and to make sure your guests hear themselves clearly. Compactness for a podcast that has to go to multiple places.\\n\\nI tested these JVC HARX500 against the following: JVC HARX330, Monoprice Premium Hi-Fi Dj Style,\\nVogek On Ear Headphones with Mic, Tascam TH-02, Koss UR20, and Panasonic RP-HT161-K.\\n\\nHere is how they stacked up:\\nJVC HARX330: decent clarity and lower profile for over the ear headphones but they really hurt my ears because they didn't completely cover my ears\\nMonoprice Premium Hi-Fi Dj Style: If this purchase was for just listening to music or doing something other than my needs, this would have been my choice. The set was comfortable, albeit a bit on the heavy side and the clarity was unsurpassed. By far the best of all. However, these headphones had a good seal around my ears and I was unable to hear ambient noise. As a podcaster, I need to be aware of A/C units running in the background and I was unable to hear mine when wearing this. For my purposes, I need to be able to hear things that the microphone may or may not pick up.\\nVogek On Ear Headphones with Mic: I tried these just to see if on-ear headphones would work. Not for the comfort factor. However, these won the compact prize. They could fold up to the size of my palm which was a bonus.\\nTascam TH-02: with all the great reviews, I thought this was going to be a winner. However, it was very bulky and didn't fit on my head properly. Good quality sound but still not great. So it didn't win the prize for comfort because of its weight. These however did fold so they could have gotten a bonus point for compactness.\\nKoss UR20: These things were a beast. This means it didn't pass the compact test. However, the sound clarity was terrible. I was amazed at how distorted voices were. It sounded like every time I talked I could hear myself clipping and I didn't hear that with any other headphone.\\nPanasonic RP-HT161-K: Decent slimmer profile but didn't pass the comfort test.\\n\\nThe JVC HARX500 met 2 of the 3 conditions I felt were the most important, comfort and clarity. After putting on these headphones, I just felt like I could easily have them on for hours without any worry of fatigue or my ears hurting. The sound coming from the speakers was true to self and was great for the price point. As mentioned above, it still allows some ambient noise to penetrate so you can hear background noise and isn't completely noise isolation which I needed. These fail the compact use case but they are still slimmer in profile compared to the Monoprice and Koss ones. I can overlook that for the top 2 needs\", 'Produto bem acabado, som límpido.

And the sound is mellow with soft jazz - haven't tried them on Rock (& probably never will!) but they do have a good balance. Again, with not using them regularly, I can't speak to battery life real well, but just having them lay around & using them occasionally, the battery held up real well, and the charge time doesn't seem to be too long. Noise is not completely blocked out but, for me, that's OK - I can still be aware of what's around me, just well muffled. I would definitely recommend them.\", 'So far so good but I’ve only had them a day. I’m wearing them now listening to soft classical at a moderate level - this is important. I have the “noise canceling” feature turned on and I can still hear the news from my iPad sitting a few feet away. If it were true noise canceling, I shouldn’t be able to hear a baby screaming in my arms.\\nNot truly noise canceling but it does cut out a lot of background clutter if you’re truly trying to focus or tune something out.\\n\\nThe sound is good, they were easy to charge though it did take longer than I would have wanted. They fit my head well and cover my ears completely.', \"I have had a pair for a couple months, and they had the most desirable qualities among affordable Bluetooth headsets. I had just ordered a second pair for work, and before it arrived I accidentally discovered that these headphones actually have multipoint capabilities. That is, I have them connected to both my work laptop for zoom calls and my phone for music at the same time. There's no switching between devices. When you start paying sounds on one, it overrides the other and vice versa. I have excessively large ears and head, and this headset fits my ears and doesn't press on my temples. The sound quality is great in my opinion, but I'm also not an audiophile. The noise cancellation isn't perfect, but it's great for the price point. The only real downside is that the mic didn't swing out, and the mic quality is not great. Other people can hear me, but it sounds like I'm on speakerphone.\", 'Pretty high quality. Bass is great. I wish they got a little louder, but that’s probably a safety feature so you don’t damage your hearing', \"I am just an average user and don't expect much for a pair of headphones at this price point, but I was happy with them after I first got them. The sound at the lowest volume setting is louder than I like but I can live with it. Noise cancelling works pretty well for the price. Battery life served my needs, and didn't notice any change in battery power over time. I have a small head, and the headband is a little bit long for me.\\n\\nThe plastic bracket for the left earpiece broke off after less than 1 year of heavy but careful use. I suppose this is expected for headphones of this design, but I wish they weren't as disposable as the ones I grew up with. I added on a warranty just so I could get a refund without a lot of hassle. It is unfortunate that it broke structurally, because otherwise I would have been content to keep using them.\", \"It works great. Easy pairing and connection. The quality of the sound is great too. But it doesn't have an excellent noise canceling.\", \"I like these headphones a lot. They're very cute, comfortable, and have decent sound quality for the price. I don't think they noise cancel more than other headphones but are definitely a huge step up from earbuds. I haven't had them die on me and have used them for many hours at a time.\\n\\nMy issues with them are that sometimes the Bluetooth cuts out and I have to turn them off and back on to reset them. Also, my phone (iPhone 11) didn't originally go straight to Bluetooth, and when I manually set it, I've been told that the microphone quality isn't good (muffled, difficult to understand).\\n\\nI think these are a great pick for the price and useful as a university student.\", \"The noise cancellation function is excellent. It is good quality, simple to operate, and easy to carry. Using these headphones for listening to music makes me very happy; the headphones are very light, and wearing them for a few hours doesn't make me feel any uncomfortable. I can enjoy my music time and feel really good. Whenever my mood is low, I will wear it to listen to music for a while. I like this product a lot, and I will recommend it to my friends who also love to listen to music.

The T16’s from Bmani are a huge improvement, and here is why:\\n\\n1: Bass! My main reason for wanting a different ear Bud was the Jabras had zero bass. Harder music was sadly reproduced.\\n\\n2: Clarity. I listened to these today for the first time, and I heard several song lyrics I had never heard before. It was really wild to understand something I had missed hundreds of times before.\\n\\n3: Fit. My Jabra’s stayed in pretty good, even when onewheeling off-road in bumpy conditions. However, the Bmani set feels like I could do backflips and they’d stay put. Comfortably, I might add!\\n\\n4: These can be used with one earbud or both! This is a game changer. I can now have one in and listen to music but still hear my wife talking to me. (The music would stop if I put one of them in the case with the Jabra unit.) Two people could even share, I suppose!\\n\\n5: As a result of the single earbud mode, each earbud has independent volume and multifunction buttons. Very intuitively designed! In fact, I put the earbuds in before looking closely at them, and I was able to turn up the volume up just assuming the buttons were what they are. You can tell the designers of these also used them.\\n\\n6: The charging case! Ok, the case feels like cheap plastic. But, it is super functional! It even shows the power level of each earbud!\\n\\nIn short, these are fantastic earbuds for $75, but they’re way cheaper than that.', \"I got these to use at the gym and they work fine.\\n\\nThe battery life is pretty good, I've never had them die on me as far as I can remember.\\n\\nThey're pretty comfortable - I can't do ear buds, they just don't stay in my ear, but the loops on these actually make them stay relatively well.\\n\\nThe case is nice and compact, charges quickly and shows you the battery life inside it.\\n\\nThe controls on the side are easy to use, I feel sometimes those buttons don't work well but these are good.\\n\\nThe noise cancellation is questionable, it's maybe a liiiittle better than normal earbuds but if you didn't tell me they had the feature, I probably wouldn't have noticed.\\n\\nThe audio quality isn't great, about as good the default apple earpods, but I didn't get them for that.\\n\\nMy only real issue ive run into is that after about 4-5 months of having them, the case has stopped closing all the way and so one of them doesn't fully connect to the case. This means that it doesn't charge consistently, and worse - my phone will randomly connect to them when they're in my bag, sometimes even connect to them in the car, switching off my car Bluetooth which is annoying as hell.\\nI fixed this issue by folding a half of a tissue and putting it in the case and putting a hair tie around it. This keeps the earbud in place and works fine. Obviously not ideal but it's not the absolute end of the world. And for the price I feel like I got my money's worth pretty well.\", 'I almost bought a really expensive pair, but honestly these work fine, for both as headphones, and for taking calls on my phone. I don\\'t really use the buttons much, so can\\'t really speak to those! The charging case is such a great touch - I have used these every day with my laptop for a few weeks and haven\\'t really had to charge it yet. (I\\'m not doing anything that would use a ton of battery like listening to music - I\\'m mostly just working on my laptop and streaming the occasional meeting.) They pair easily, and the sound is great! Don\\'t know that I need anything more than that! One point to note is that \"noise canceling\" is one of the features you can rate in this review, but I didn\\'t rate it good or bad, since these are not noise canceling. That being said, when I\\'m using these with my computer, I only wear one in my ear because otherwise I can\\'t hear anything around me.\\n\\nAlso, I want to mention that they fit my very small ears perfectly! I don\\'t \"plug\" them fully into my ears, because they wouldn\\'t stay in my small ear canals anyway, but the wraparound feature works great. I\\'ve even worn them to do an online workout!

Although, I have been through my fair share of headphones and earphones, I can definitely say without a doubt that these headphones are one of the best ones I've had. I had always bought Beats headphones because honestly I was buying the brand so people knew I was wearing trendy headphones but after a few uses of the Beats studio 3 wireless, the cushion started to peel off. Not only that, it affected the audio and it sounded mushy and really bad. It was hurting my ears. Yes, they were comfortable but after a long time they started to feel uncomfortable. Anyways, back to these headphones. In terms of cushion, it doesn't peel at all. I am a very sweaty dude and every headphone and earphone has stopped working after a few months because of sweat (I'm guessing) but these really did last long. They are rather uncomfortable, my left ear always ends up hurting the most even when I adjust them so the only issue I have with them is that when I'm trying to relax they always end up hurting my ear when I wear them too long.\\n\\nThe sound is crisp and clean. I was honestly expecting a raunchy sound from cheap headphones but boy oh boy was I incorrect. These headphones proved me wrong and they really show that even after workout sessions, they truly are a top quality headphone material.\\nNoise cancellation was also very very good. I can barely hear anything even when my volume is rather low. It's a good thing when you're in a library trying to listen to your music at a somewhat silent rate and at the same time, not hearing people around you whisper to each other. It really does do its justice and lives up to its expectations.\\nAll in all, these headphones are amazing for such a cheap price. The sound is amazing, the ease of buttons is amazing, the fact that you can change the quality of sound is amazing, everything about these headphones are amazing. The only thing I would change is the comfortableness of the cushion because they kinda hurt after a while. Maybe it's my ears but hopefully for the next person they are okay with that feature. I recommend these headphones over any beats headphones out there without a doubt. Take it from me who spent about $320 on one pair. I could've bought these and extra pairs if another one stopped functioning rather than spending $200 on repairs for Beats. New buyers of sport headphones or any headphone users. PLEASE BUY THESE HEADPHONES! :D\", 'left them in the car for two to three days and still had enough charge for the gym for a couple of hours. Once i started to play my music I heard absolutely nothing. The best headphones for the price.', 'They feel like kids dollar store headphones but the sound is clear and the Bluetooth connection works for a good distance. Perfect for the gym cause I would rather forget these at the gym then my beats. Also sweat will destroy the leather on the beats and this are still in tact after a few cardio sessions. Easy to connect. The buttons are kind of useless to me', \"so i think the age of me wearing airpods is over (just kidding, i have them on reserve for when these run out of battery) which prompted me to buy noise cancelling over-the-ear headphones. i was not disappointed.\\n\\nnot only are these extremely stylish, but they're cheap too. for the quality put into these, i wouldn't be surprised if they were over twenty. alas, the poor kids are in luck. they're very generous when you put them on, and when they're off, you can hang them around your neck no problem. they're super comfortable as well, given that the plush leather on the inside keeps your ears from feeling muffled. now if only i had that but for my gaming headphones.\\n\\nthe battery life lasts for quite some time and it's okay if you forget to turn off the headphones like i do on occasion because they do turn off automatically. if i had the space, i'd definitely buy another one just for the hell of it.\", 'Of course they are cheap and mine broke after a drop off an end table but the sound is decent', \"I would like to start off being honest, these headphones are waterproof. You can shower with these things on (DO NOT SUBMERGE THIS HEADPHONES IN WATER, THESE ARE NOT FOR SWIMMING). And that's really the only good thing about it. When I received my headphones, the left earphone was already quieter than the right. I tried switching between mono and stereo sound to make a difference but it did nothing. The sound quality is not good to put it nicely. Even with the right headphone being the loudest, any earbuds or wires I ever had out did these headphones. After two days of using these headphones, I couldn't take it anymore and went to look inside the earphones. I find one of the wires thinning because the manufacturer did not add enough glue to make it stick. I found two wires thinner then shredded paper inside. When I tried to move the open earphone around to see if I could see anything else, the poorly glued wire popped off. So now my left earphone is permanently broken (Yes I tried to use foil and glue myself to fix it) and I'm waiting for a refund. Sure, you can say that my headphones were just a manufacturing mistake and buy them to see for yourself. But trust me random stranger, you DO NOT want these headphones! They may be cheap, but literally spending 10$ or even 5$ more can get you something 3x better.\\n\\nTo the manufactures if you are reading this, this product has A LOT of potential. You have the SD card, the radio, noise cancellation, and the battery life. The only problem is that these headphones are WAY too cheap! Please upgrade the wiring (please make them thicker, and maybe add more wiring if needed), and the sound quality (make the speakers, bigger, better, and louder). And maybe you can change the plastic casing of the headphones to make them feel less cheap, but I never really had a problem with that. I know these upgrades more than likely will raise the price of these headphones a little. But you should consider it because I had headphones and earbuds miles better than this for 5$ more.\\n\\nI STRONGLY recommend to anyone thinking to buy this product, please go for something above 20 dollars.

Originally, I was looking for Bose-like headphones. I bought BOHM ones (off of Amazon) to try, and ended up returning them because there was no visible noise-cancellation (and they were close to $100). These have better noise cancellation - they definitely do not silence people around you, but they do make things quieter, even without music playing. With music playing, you can pretty much zone out, which is pretty much perfect. I've also tried a more expensive pair of Sony Headphones (they were close to $200) - I would say that the noise-cancelling feature is pretty much the same... at least, I didn't notice much of a difference between the two quality-wise. The more expensive Sonys were better quality in terms of material, look, and the speakers encapsulate your ears more effectively. But for the price, I would overwhelmingly choose these ones!\\nAs an example, I'm currently writing this review in my apartment with the dish washer and dryer running... they're pretty loud. When I flip the noise-cancel switch (I don't have any music playing), the humming is gone, but I can still hear the swishing of the water in the dishwasher.\\nThese headphones are perfect for when you're on the 'quiet' floor of the library, and that one person starts eating a bag of carrots... ugh that's the worst!\\nI also like how they fold up, I'm in college, so I just smoosh them into my backpack. They're much more comfortable than earbuds for studying, they don't hurt your ears.\\nSide note: I definitely prefer these to bluetooth headphones - you don't need to charge them, all you need is a single battery.\\n\\nOverall, I'm very happy with my purchase. These are inexpensive, functional, and have great sound quality!\", 'Good noise cancelling for the price. We use it on all our international flights and it definitely muffles all sounds. Hard to sleep with since they are bulky, but we still love it.', 'Compared to a set of Beats headphones, this is a good if not exceptional set of over-the-ear headphones. Recently I acquired a digital practice saxophone which, for latency reasons, only uses analog headphones for private practice so the Bluetooth only Beats wouldn’t work. Ear buds are not for me so I went looking for traditional wired headphones which are getting more rare as wireless technology gets better. That Sony now offers noise-reduction at a such a low price is an added benefit that I was keen to try out. The noise-reduction does work but at a much lesser level than you might get with more expensive headphones. Whether this is because of the hardware or because the ear muffs don’t isolate as well, I can’t say. Sound quality is decent, nothing great but nothing horrible either. For $30 this is a good deal.', 'They actually did moderate noise cancelling on the plane with the switch turned on. I use them a lot with the ROKU and the sound is great off the TV. nBattery lasts a long time if you remember to shut ir off after use.', \"I ordered these on a co-workers recommendation, but they may go back. Though comfortable for my couple hour long testing, the sound quality doesn't cut it for me. With power off the sound is dull & flat. Turning on power boosts the volume & adds a little clarity to the sound. I compared power on & off in various levels of constant background noise from a running fridge to a loud bathroom exhaust fan. With or without music playing the noise reduction was minimal. I don't expect them to match high end/priced models, but these don't cut down enough steady sound to stay in my bag of headphones. I hate to spend the money, but the $350 Sony phones did wonders to almost all the background noise in Best Buy... If only there were a middle ground for $100 to $200.\\n\\nUpdate 2018.04.27: I've used these at work for a few days now. I rotate skiing these, old Bose, and new Mpow 059 phones. The 10 year old Bose sound better than the others, but let in too much external noise. We have a wire noise system at work that these Sony phones can't overcome. They got a bit uncomfortable after 6 hours or so. Still good sound for price though a pad where they sit on top of the head would be a nice addition.\\n\\nUpdate 2018.04.30: The most maddening thing about these that I somehow neglected to point out is that the battery cover falls (fell) off almost daily and today I didn't notice and lost it somewhere. Now what?! Wish I returned them while I had all the parts.\", \"These work very well and I'm excited that I tried them. And for the price they can't be beat. I do have to say that the noise cancelling is a bit weak but I compared them to 250.00 types so that isn't really fair. They do give some relief but in general the calls and sound is very clear and better than a pair that I paid over twice for. If you are on a tight budget and you need phones with these features then these are a winner.\", 'This is great value for money. Got it for my spouse and kids and they all love it.

The leather is beautiful and supple, the metal arms seem bombproof, and the plastic used for the earcups is of the highest quality. I love that the leather is used for the earcups, which allows for a cool, very comfortable sensation against the head, as well as the headband. The Fidelio L3 logo is subtly embossed at the center of the headband. The earcups are perfect circles, giving the headphones an elegant and timeless design.\\n\\nIn short, I love these headphones.\\n\\nOf course, in this category of high-end ANC headphones, the benchmark is the Sony XM4. I have been testing these Fidelios against my new (Dec 2021) Sony XM4s. In terms of build quality, these L3s *blow the Sony\\'s out of the water.* By comparison, the Sony\\'s feel cheap and like they\\'ll crack at any moment - and, in fact, there are a number of reviewers who have ran into exactly that problem. (Take a look at the numerous images of cracked and useless XM4s on their Amazon page.) The Sony\\'s seem to have a structural weakness at the pivot where the earcup connects to the headband, and too many people for me to feel comfortable with have reported the headphones snapping at that point. Sony customer service refuses to repair or replace these, even if it\\'s within warranty, because they consider it \"damage.\" This has practical consequences; if I want to take a nap with my headphones on, I always choose the Fidelios because the Sony\\'s make me afraid that if I turn on my side and put pressure against the earcup, they will snap. At this price point, Sony should be doing much, much better. My opinion is that Sony has become accustomed to the fact that everyone seems to consider the XM4s the best-in-class, and, as a result, the company has become lazy, seeking to maximize their margins by using cheap plastics, fake leather, and generally neglecting the build quality.\\n\\nCan you imagine dropping $350 on your headphones, only to have them snap on you within a year? That\\'s insane.\\n\\nSo, in short, the Fidelios seem to me to offer the best build quality of any headphones in this price range. I think I\\'ll be able to throw them into my bag when I\\'m rushing off to work or traveling for years to come and not worry about any damage. They are that solid. They are a pleasure to hold and look at.\\n\\nWith all of that said, the Fidelios are not as excellent when it comes to the sound and ANC. I can tell that the XM4s have better noise cancelling than the Fidelios. Even worse, I have noticed a very subtle high pitched tone coming from the Fidelios at times, mostly when the volume is up high. I\\'m still testing to see whether it\\'s a problem with my Bluetooth connection or audio player, but I think it may simply be a defect.\\n\\nThe other issue I\\'ve noticed is that the mic on the Fidelios hasn\\'t been super clear on my Zoom calls. (I\\'m on a 2018 Surface 6 Tablet, so that may have something to do with it.) That\\'s a major drawback for me, but it\\'s not an issue when they are plugged in. I also have about 5 or 6 Bluetooth connections going on at the same time and that\\'s caused connectivity issues with the Sony\\'s too, so I need to continue testing once I\\'ve reduced the number of Bluetooth connections. When I remove the other Bluetooth connections, I haven\\'t had issues.\\n\\n(In case you run into the same issue, there is a reliable workaround: Get yourself a BT receiver, such as the TP-Link USB Bluetooth Receiver. The issue seems to stem from the BT connections interfering with each other.)\\n\\nThis is the first year that the Fidelios have been out and I am confident that with the next iteration, Philips will get better at the ANC. I expect these headphones to quickly overtake the XM4s in the years to come. They just need to develop the audio quality. Philips has phenomenal sound quality on some of its other headphones, such as the open-backed Fidelio X2HRs, which I also love. (The soundstage and overall sound quality on these is noticeably better than the XM4s and Fidelio L3s.) The question is whether the headphone review industry will move on from its fixation on the XM4s, as far as public recognition goes.\\n\\nI highly recommend these headphones, but you will need to test them with your actual use-cases to figure out whether they match what matters most to you.', 'This headset is amazing when it works, BUT, my unit came extremely bad:\\nWear sensor doesn\\'t actually works, it pauses the reproduction when you lower or unwear the headset, but it doesn\\'t turn it on when you wear again, need to restart the device everytime, so decided to just disable that feature every time I switch the headset on\\nMulti link works 50% of the time, the other 50% it can\\'t get paired with laptop and smartphone at the same time, no matter how many times I try to pair, or how many combinations of \"laptop first - smartphone first\" I do\\nNow it suddenly started to auto shutoff while playing media, for no reason, again need to restart the device and sometimes, to re-pair.\\n\\nSo to make a resume:\\nPros: amazing sound, really well build quality and transport bag+case, really confortable, ANC works great on all modes, lots of playtime per charge and it charges pretty quickly\\n\\nCons: mobile app its really slugish (even on a top-of-the-line smartphone), audio cable is REALLY thin (really, like half the diameter of a classic audio cable); and at least on my unit, multilink not working, same as wear sensor, and that random shutoffs\\n\\n(Yes I tried to contact to Philips, but NEVER got a reponse)', \"I was in the market to replace some Soundcore Q30s that I got a few years of use out of. I really enjoyed them, however, they fell apart beyond what electrical tape and super glue could remedy. In a market saturated with low to mid priced options and questioning Soundcore's build quality, I embarked on a quest for a serviceable pair of headphones for under $100. After going 0/3, I took a shot in the dark with the Philips TAH 9505 headphones. I purchased them used for $42 and change on Amazon. Result: Pleasantly surprised! The sound quality is better than the Q30s IMO, especially in the mid to high ranges. The pads for the ears are thick and quite comfortable, though the phones clamp a little tight. ANC is good enough for me, while the cups seal quite well, eliminating the need for ANC in many situation. All that being said, if you're frustrated by the lack of solid and affordable options, give these a try.\", 'These are some very good headphones, overall. They have good sound quality, they’re pretty easy to pair, and they have pretty long battery life. The noise canceling isn’t the best, but they cut out a decent amount of sound. The case that they come with is simple, but it’s very nice. However, they do have some flaws. They aren’t the most comfortable, as I’ve found that I have to take them off and wait a bit before I can wear them again. They also have some mild inconveniences about them, like the obnoxious touch controls, and that they make weird noises once in a while. Despite that, though, these are overall very good. I recommend them', \"These arrived a day earlier than expected and I was so excited to test them out. So far, the L3s perform very well for the price, noise cancellation is very effective, and it sounds really good with all the songs I've tested on it, it also works quite well for gaming which is sort of a given, however my only complaints thus far is that I can't seem to use these plugged into my PC via both USB-C and the included audio jack, both of which are fairly thin cables, overall though I would recommend these just for their performance alone.\", 'Me encantaron.. buen sonido y muy cómodos.', '', 'First the good. Sound is very good, I like the \"Awareness On\" mode so I can hear people talking to me, and it is comfortable and has a long battery life.\\nOk, construction materials for the headband - fire the engineer who selected a brittle spring material. Mine broke in 2 audible cracks right in the middle after a few months. Fortunately it still holds ok on my head, but honestly, they did zero durability testing on this. That is not what I expected from Philips.\\nNow there is a software app that you need to download to get to some of the options. No one from Phillips did any product testing with any significant cross section of real users.\\n1. On-headset buttons don\\'t always work. For example the button turning awareness on, or more frequently the TouchPad sensor does not pause or raise volume etc. To fix this I need the software interface on my Samsung S20 FE phone and toggle touchpad sensor on/off switch. This software sometimes will not boot up, and I need to close and reopen the software. Then every time it takes at least 24 seconds to start.\\nPhilips is proud of their \"wear sensor\". This is supposed to pause whenever you remove the headset. That would be great, but mine also pauses if I tip my head forward or move my head too fast, and then it doesn\\'t resume. I have to hold my hand over the TouchPad sensor as a hack to resue play, but at this point it is even more sensitive and pauses for very minor movements. Way too sensitive. So I usually turn off the wear sensor - which doesn\\'t always work right away.\\nBut headphones are forgetful you see, and so next time you turn them on, it assumes it knows what you want - which is its default settings. NC on -not awareness on as I last used, wear sensor on - not off like I prefer, so I will fiddle with the buttons to get what I want. Honestly, does 8 bits of memory cost too much or did no one consider users would like to save their last settings?', \"I bought these headphones for my wife for her birthday for her to use in her office for meetings and listening to music. The sound was great and so was the microphone but only a few months after we bought them the plastic on the side cracked and the headphone would no longer sit flush to her ear. This is after only regular wear and tear in a controlled environment. For over 200 dollars I can't believe they were this cheaply made! My children have 20 dollar headphones that haven't broken like this after being sat on and dropped over and over again. Buyer beware!\\n\\nI tried to use Philips warranty to replace the headphones. It was like a black hole of emails and phone calls between 3 different departments. I was feeling stubborn so I persisted for 3 months in following up and checking to make sure our case was being dealt with but after 3 months we were told the warranty doesn't cover wear and tear. So that was that... I can't say how disappointed I am in what I thought was a great company.\", 'The noise cancelling was not well enough for my taste. I was still able to hear my husband talking while I was listening to my music. The sound was very good. I did find the ears on the headset were heavy. My biggest complaint was that the only way to increase and decrease the volume or skip songs was on the ear set. All you had to do was swipe your finger across, up or down on the ear piece. If you didn’t touch it in the exact spot or if your swipe was a little off. Sometime when I swiped up to increase the sound it would not work. When I wanted to skip a song it would replay instead of skip. I found that very frustrating. Maybe it was because the touch pad was too sensitive. The quality was there, just not practical.

I guess I could’ve waited until after I tried them out, but I’ve never had a company require a review to get the warranty before so I was suspicious.\\n\\nThere’s a card in the case that offers something free if you leave a five star rating with “no words and no photos”, then take a screenshot of the review and send that and your order ID to an Outlook email address. I’ve been an Amazon shopper for many years and never seen anything like that before - makes me question every good review on here.\\n\\nThe “noise-canceling” is laughable. It even says in the instructions for use that it only works for low-frequency noise and not high-frequency, like human voices. You get what you pay for so I guess I should’ve kept my expectations low.\\n\\nReturning these things was a hassle. I couldn’t drop it off at the local Amazon drop off merchant where you literally hand over the product, they scan the QR code in the app, and that’s it - I had to package it up, print out and tape the return label on the box, and drop it off at UPS.

I highly recommend them to parents looking for high-quality headphones for their kids!\", \"I've bought several of these for my kids. Love them, but have had to replace two of them in a year's time. One broke when my son was taking them off (could entirely be him being rough on them, but alas, they still broke) and the mic went out on one other pair. Still like them, love that they fold up, have microphones and sturdy, cloth-covered cords. They're also comfortable for my kids.\", 'We ordered one for our son, age 6, for when we travel. We were impressed with how well it works. We also like that it has ear protection, as well as the option to make it louder for ambient noise like on airplanes. We ordered another one for him to use at school, and we also ordered one for his sister. The one we ordered for school broke recently, and it was still under a year. So we contacted customer service, and they were fantastic! They replied quickly, attempted to troubleshoot the issue, and then they sent us a replacement for our broken one, when it was clear it couldn’t be fixed. For the price, quality, and service- buying this is a no-brainer. And the other headphones we have from them for longer have had no issues and work well. Highly recommend.', 'My kid has high functioning autism and he has never complained about these as he usually does with other headphones! Very durable and good sound for the price!', 'Originally purchased our first pair for distance learning as our sons had to share a room and were in separate classes. They worked great to help them stay focused and hear only their class. Mic worked great as well for the teacher to hear them. Purchased again for in school use while doing their independent computer work and they work great with no issues.', \"I buy these several times a year for my kids and they are perfect!

I usually purchase two at a time so I always have a backup.\\nWe've tried other kids headphones and they just don't hold up nearly as long.\", 'Bought for school use to plug into school devices when working independently. The volume limits was one of the key things I wanted and it delivered. The size/fit was also great for my kid (8) at the smallest setting. And I myself was able to wear them when both sides were extended to the fullest (gives about 1 inch additional height on both sides). As mentioned because I was able to put them on my head, I was able to confirm the volume was at an acceptable level.\\n\\nA couple more things I hope to test in the next little while would be the button control (start/stop/skip music) and the \"listen together\" jack. will report back when that is done :) Will also see how it holds up to real life kid usage.\\n\\nColors are a nice pastel shade and my daughter loves it.

Usually I'm a bit too lazy to right reviews but I just gotta say these are great.\\nI have some higher quality pricier over the ear headphones and I keep reverting back to using these. They're light, comfortable, the battery life is great and they look awesome.\\nPlus I'm noticing the range of the Bluetooth seems to be better than my higher price headphones. I can leave my phone in my bedroom and be out in the living room and these stay connected while my higher price headphones seem to cut out at that distance.\\nPlus, these seem to sit on my head better than my more expensive headsets too.\\nHonestly I got these because they were a cheaper option at the time, but I still use these just about daily and only end up using my higher prices headphones while this set is charging.\\nThis is by far the best headset I have.\", \"I bought these headphones to see how they stood up to the Skullcandy Crusher Evo Headphones.\\n\\nThough they are just as attractive and really comparable, the sound quality on them isn't as solid.

But I'm no expert on soud quality, so my satisfaction may be your disappointment. Bass is there but not as extreme as the description makes it sound.\\n\\nBattery life is average. My last pair could go four days of continuous use on one full charge whereas this one barely just barely makes it to 48 hours. Might do you better if you use your headphones less often than I do.\\n\\nWhen I used these headphones with my HP Laptop (especially on Youtube or similiar video hosting sites) I have to be careful not to pause the media too often or leave it pause to long, because when I press play again no sound will come through the heaphones even though its connected and the video is clearly playing. I used to be able to fix this by refreshing the page but that stopped working, so now I have to disconnect the bluetooth entirely and connect it again to fix it.

These headphones have become a staple for my twins, both at home and school, and here's why I give them a well-deserved 5-star rating:\\n\\n1. **Durability:** These headphones are built to withstand the wear and tear of active kids. Over the years, they've endured countless drops, tugs, and twists and are still going strong. That kind of durability is hard to beat!\\n\\n2. **Comfortable Fit:** My twins find these headphones comfortable to wear for extended periods. The on-ear design is just the right size for their little ears and provides a secure fit without being too tight.\\n\\n3. **Safe Volume Levels:** I appreciate the built-in volume control that ensures my kids' delicate ears are protected. It's a reassuring feature for a parent.\\n\\n4. **Tangle-Free Cord:** The tangle-free cord design is a small but appreciated detail. It saves us from the frustration of untangling knots every time they want to use their headphones.\\n\\n5. **Clear Sound:** Despite being budget-friendly, these headphones deliver surprisingly clear and crisp sound quality, allowing my kids to enjoy their music, movies, or educational content without any compromise.\\n\\n6. **Priced Right:** The affordability of these headphones is a major plus. I've bought multiple pairs over the years, and it doesn't break the bank.\\n\\n7. **Variety of Colors:** The availability of different colors is a nice touch, allowing my twins to pick their favorite and express their individuality.\\n\\nIn summary, the JLab JBuddies Studio On-Ear Kids Wired Headphones have been a reliable and cost-effective choice for my twins. They're built to last, comfortable to wear, and offer peace of mind with safe volume levels. I highly recommend them to other parents looking for durable and reasonably priced headphones for their kids. These headphones easily earn a 5-star rating!\", \"We love these headphones for our little one. He's got a pair for at home and a pair that was sent in to school for their media/computer time there. Flexible and durable - they've held up really well to a lot of use.\", 'From the child for whom they were purchased: \"They\\'re really good; they work on my iPad [at school].\"', 'For the price these are great quality kids headphones. We bought these things to replace more expensive headphones and we are now fans of these. Buy some for your kids. They work great!', \"These fit my giant-headed almost-7 year old perfectly; probably with a little room to grow. They're comfortable and get the job done easily. They seem sturdy, too. Will update after he's used them for a while, we'll see how well they stand up to him. Thanks for a great looking product!\\n\\nPS - packaging was great too, nice and simple.\", \"So far so good. Just received this tonight and tested it out. It has very good audio quality for the price and purpose, and the volume limiting circuitry seems to do the job; the volume can get loud, but not loud enough to hurt the ears. I would still advise your child to exercise responsibility and only set the volume high enough to hear and no more, but it's nice to know it has that extra protection in case a device is capable of putting out too much volume and is set too high on initial activation. The look and construction are both very good, and I have high confidence this will perform well for its purpose in grade school. If it turns out to not be as durable as I expect, my review and rating here will change.\\n\\nThe fit is very good for a kid grade school that is beyond their toddler/kindergarten years.\", 'Good quality and sound', \"I purchased these and some JBL JR 300 to gift to a younger family member. I decided to test both and see which would end up being the better headphones.\\n\\nThe JBuddies feel like they are made of stronger material, except the size adjustments sliders, which are just a couple of thin metal rods per side that seemed like they could get bent out of shape pretty easy. They also had a vulnerable point, the signal wires going to the ear cups are exposed and could snag on something or get pulled by absent minded fingers.\\n\\nThe JBL JR 300 felt a little more plasticky, not much more. Also the fake leather covering the ear pads felt thinner. However there were no vulnerable wires or any overt weak points and no exposed signal wires. The cord is not a round wire, it is flat like a ribbon which feels kind of thin compared to a traditional round wire.\\n\\nI used a basic sound meter (factory calibrated, not certified) to test how loud they would get. Quieter is safer for young ears, so lower dB is better. Safety standards that are often quoted claim 85dB is the upper limit for safe sound levels.\\n\\nThe JBuddies won out here, they wouldn't go past about 80dB no matter how much I tried to push them. The JBL JR 300 went right up to the line at 85dB.\\n\\nNext was sound quality, tested by having me and another family member listen to a variety of music.\\n\\nThe JBL JR 300 easily won this comparison. The sound was cleaner, clearer, and bass/midrange/treble were balanced very well. These sound like adult headphones, just not as loud.\\n\\nThe JBuddies had a touch too much midrange and lower treble. This gave them a sort of muffled sound. I found myself trying hard to hear some instrument, voice, or other sound.\\n\\nI ended up keeping the JBL JR 300, to gift to my family, and sending the JBuddies back. My reasoning was two-fold.\\n\\nFirst, the JBuddies thin metal rods and exposed signal wire don't inspire any confidence in it's ability to survive life with kids. The JBL JR 300 is a more solid structure and feels more kid-proof.\\n\\nSecond, while the JBuddies maxed out at a lower volume, the more muffled sound quality caused me to want to listen at the higher volumes just to try and hear things better. The JBL JR 300, being clean and clear allowed me to hear at lower volumes and did not make me feel the need to turn it up.\\n\\nWith a few adjustments, the JBuddies could be great kids headphones, I hope JLab refines them and puts out a better product in the future. I love their Retro Rewind Headphones, so I know they can put out something with more quality. Right now, the JBL JR 300 get my vote.\", 'Mis audífonos llegaron dañados de la entrada, adicional solo se escucha el del lado derecho.', '', 'Good sound regulation not crossing proper limit, comfortable for kid, she likes it.

Tried everything and could not get it to work. Before getting it ready for it\\'s return trip to Amazon, I tried substituting another mini-plug cable that I had laying around and , voila! It now works fine. So the supplied mini-plug cable was defective.\\n\\nThat issue resolved, this is really a pretty nice headphone setup. It was dead simple to set up. Installing the provided rechargeable battery into the headphones was a little tricky, but not a big deal. The sound quality is quite good - the \"speech\" setting boosts the treble a bit to make things a little easier to understand. The volume control on the headphone is a little tight to move, but I just left it a 5 and use the volume control on the TV which gives me all the range I need. Note that this will probably work only if you are using the headphone jack on the TV for the input. The headphones are pretty comfortable - not too much pressure on your ears, but still fit snugly enough to block out most outside noise. My only gripe is the indicator light on the charging base. It lights up red when the headphones are charging, but then extinguishes when the charge is complete. It would be nice if it would turn green to show a full charge.\\n\\nI would give it 5 starts, but I\\'m deducting one star for a lax quality control that allowed my unit to ship with a defective mini-plug cable.\\n\\nAnd speaking of cables, the vendor threw in a mini-plug to 2 RCA plug adapter cable that is not included in the Sony package. Just a nice little extra so there are enough provided audio cables to cover any setup your TV might have.\\n\\nEDIT: Ended up having to return this to Amazon. It worked fine for 2 days and then went DOA again. I disconnected and reconnected everything and, again, it worked OK. Next day, DOA again. The problem has to be in the power supply or the audio cable to the TV, but I didn\\'t feel like having to do more troubleshooting. Packed it up (glad I saved the box and packing) and sent it back to Amazon for a refund.', 'Good sound. Good battery life. Easy to get in the charger. Easy connection; just hit the auto connect button and they hook up.', \"The headphones were extremely easy to set up. They do a great job of being able to enjoy TV without having the TV turned up too loud for others. The biggest complaint is that while watching a show, there is a momentary drop in sound. Sometimes it goes days without the issue and then some days it might drop 4 or 5 times during a show. Just simply turning my head seems to resolve the problem so not sure if it is a signal problem or a malfuction. Other than that, I really enjoy the ability to watch a show and be able to hear it without it being too loud for my wife.

Very clear left-right separation, good bass, and overall decent quality. A little muddy at times particularly in the mid-range, but generally pleasant.\\n- Sound with voice sources is more than sufficient.\\n- Sound with games is also more than sufficient, again due to go left right separation, decent bass, and enough clarity across the frequency range that normal gaming sounds are clear and identifiable.\\n- Microphone has gotten generally low marks from people on phone calls and online meetings - its been described as muffled and sounding like I'm down a long hallway from the other person.\\n- Bluetooth - lost a star here, specifically for the lack of being able to put it in pairing mode if its already talking to another device. In general pairing was quick. It does need to be disconnected from one source in my experience before it will connect with another (i.e. I had to force-disconnect it from my laptop before I could search for and connect it to my phone). There appears to be no way from the headset it self to force it into paring mode if it is actively paired with a device. Bluetooth range actually seemed better than my go-to's from a sound perspective - I could be a couple of rooms away from the source and still hear clearly (sometimes my galaxy buds will drop the connection from the same location).\\n- Fit and finish is reasonable for the price point - buttons are clearly labeled have a solid click to them. The power / play buttton isn't completely flush with the outside shell of the headphone, but not a big deal. They are a little stiff right out of the box and they are on-the-ear, so a little more pressure on the ears initially. I expect they will wear in over time.\\n- Overall these seem like a really good value option - not highly recommended if your main use is for voice, but otherwise a good pair of relatively inexpensive bluetooth headphones suitable for sound in gaming as well as watching videos / listening to audio.\\n\\nFWIW My go to's generally are Bose QC30's (almost 10 years old) and Galaxy Buds II for reference, so I'm reviewing this based on the price point, not as a comparison to my main headsets.\", \"My son recently told me that he was being bullied on the bus ride home. That seriously triggered me because some kids... they're just mean. So I've been strategizing on how to keep my son busy on the Middle School bus ride and one of our ideas was to get him headphones so he could just ignore the kids and hopefully, they'll leave him alone. I ordered these headphones for just that purpose. Came in great, sturdy packaging (really nice quality on the materials). The headphones fit him perfectly (12yo boy, plays football - not small). The ear pieces fold in for storage and snap into place easily. It charged overnight and he was able to use it for a full week (to/from school) without having to recharge it. The ride to school is about 20 mins each way. Connected with no issues with his iPhone SE. Has helped so far with the idiots that are bullying him on the bus - will update if the headphones break. So far, so good. Great quality for the price. Even if he gets a few months out of them and they get crushed, I would buy again.\", \"I liked some things about these headsets, primarly that they are small and light to wear. If you have blue tooth connection to a phone or a TV, it isn't difficult to connect. However, be aware if you have paired to a phone and then try something else and your phone is in range, it won't drop the phone and go to the new item. Unpair the phone then you can pair to your TV or other blue tooth device.\\n\\nThe sound is fine, but if you are an audio expert this won't be the headset for you. If you want a low cost, unit for yourself or a child, it should be adequate.\\n\\nInstructions: There are some language issues in the instructions as it was obviously a translation. The printed instructions are very very small type and are somewhat skimpy. With some testing and trying I was able to get some things to work as expected when connected to my TV, but it was not easy to figure out for each different connection I tried.\\n\\nI found that the micro data card is probably not going to be useful for most users as it uses, not a regular micro SD card, but a micro TF card of only 16 gigs. Apparently a TF card is NOT as SD card. I don't have a TF card so I couldn't test it, but it will physcially accept an SD card, but not read it. Therefore unless you have TF cards of 16 gigs or less, that item is of no value.\\n\\nMost mobile phones no longer have a direct audio plug, but I found that my husband's Samsung S10 does have one and music will play from that phone to the headset. The track changing did not work, nor the volume using the wired connection.\\n\\nI found to make the volume work you must hold the track/volume (+or _) button down. Then the volume on my Samsung TV did work through the headset. It would not work with the S10 through the wired connection, but does work with the bluetooth connection on my S22 phone.\\n\\nIn summary if you are looking for feature laden, high end sound, you need a different product. This is a nice low cost over the ear for TV watching or listening to sound on your phone.\"], 'detail': \"BRNEWO Wireless Bluetooth Headphones Over Ear，Hi-Fi Stereo Wireless Headphones Foldable/Wired/Wireless with Microphone/TF，Available forTravel/Adult/Kids,25Hours Playtime(Beige High-Fidelity stereo: Dual 40mm large aperture driver units and Bluetooth 5.0 technology provide a more stable transmission speed, so you can enjoy clearer and more powerful music.

I like these headphones, and I think I'll get a lot of use out of them, but there are a few problems. The first was the directions, which are not at all clear. (See attached photograph). Fortunately, even for someone who hasn't done this before, it was pretty straightforward to turn on bluetooth on my laptop and my phone and connect the device. The headphones tell you when they are pairing and when they're connected. I think you can only connect to one device at a time. I had to disconnect from my laptop before the headphones would show up as an available device on my phone. For me, that's no problem because I will probably only use them with my laptop.\\n\\nThe sound quality when listening to YouTube videos on my laptop was good. I was happy with it. It was equally good when listening to a video on my phone. However, the sound when making a call is a bit muddy, for both caller and callee. I could easily understand what my interlocutor was saying (and he could understand me), but the sound quality wasn't clear.\\n\\nConcerning the range, I could continue listening up to about 40 feet away if there were no walls between me and my laptop, but when I was in the next room, the sound cut out about 20 feet away. If there were two walls (even with open doors) between me and the laptop, I could not get a connection.\\n\\nFinally, a word about the controls. They are located on the back of the right headphone. I had to take off the headphones to use them, but I suppose when I'm used to it, I'll be able to use the controls by touch alone. Concerning the features of the device, it was easy to figure out how to pause and how to move from one track to the next (I did this using a YouTube play list). Also, if you are listening to a video and you get a phone call, it is pretty easy to switch to the call (just press the center button). However, I could not figure out how to use the FM mode to search for FM stations. I followed the directions provided, but all I succeeded in doing was skipping from one track to the next on the YouTube playlist. I could not figure out how to change from bluetooth mode to FM mode even after I disconnected the device from my phone and laptop.\\n\\nAnyway, for comfort and sound quality in everything but phone calls, these worked very well, 5/5 but for phone call sound quality and the unclear directions, I'd give them a 3/5. Hence my overall rating is 4/5. However, if, like me, you just want some reasonably priced headphones you can use to listen to music or play videos, you'd be happy with these, especially as they are super comfortable.\", 'Before anything else: these headphones will accept a micro-sd card! I\\'ve never seen this feature before - at any price - and sets these apart. Going to the gym or washing our car or anywhere else where you don\\'t want to bring your $1,000 cellphone? Just load up the micro-sd card and you don\\'t need another device. Its like having an ipod built into the headphones, and I didn\\'t see this mentioned in other reviews.\\n\\nThe headphones are light but not cheap feeling - they weight about the same as a more expensive Phillips pair. The power-sliding button IS cheap feeling but it works without issue. The other buttons aren\\'t remarkable - they don\\'t feel overly cheap nor premium. Call quality is good enough.\\n\\nThey are very comfortable on your ears and the padding is surprisingly soft - both the foam filling and the faux leather covers (see image 2).\\n\\nI tested these headphones against 3 other pairs: a $10 pair from Monoprice (center); a $100+ pair from Phillips (right), and my a pair of DT 990 PRO 250ohm from Beyerdynamic.\\n\\nThey sound much better than, and are much more comfortable than the $10 pair.\\nThey are not as comfortable, don\\'t form as good of a \"seal\" around your ears, aren\\'t as noise isolating (with noise canceling off) and don\\'t sound as clear as the $100 pair.\\nThe Beyerdynamic\\'s are wired, open-back headphones that need a decently powerful amp to drive them... so these headphones cannot match them.\\n\\nSo they\\'re better than the $10 pair, and worse than the $100 pair... great review right? They are easily worth $10 more than the cheap pair -- just based on the audio quality and comfort and build quality. I don\\'t really think the $100 pair is worth $80 dollars more than these SLOSAP headphones --- for most people. The SLOSAP\\'s sound good: they are bass-heavy like all headphones in this category, but they sound good. They are clear. They obviously don\\'t have the best fidelity/clarity/response range... but they are $20 headphones and if you aren\\'t familiar with those terms you don\\'t need to worry about it.\\n\\nThey sound really good. For $20 you cannot go wrong. I\\'ve been wearing them daily and will use them when doing things like mowing the lawn or going to the gym or just in the office - where I need something lightweight and comfortable, but don\\'t need the sound to be 100% accurate.'], 'detail': 'SLOSAP Wireless Over Ear Bluetooth Headphones 20H Playtime Wireless Headphones with Microphone, HiFi Stereo, Deep Bass Foldable Headset Memory Foam Ear Cups Enjoy powerful, clear sound, with a deep bass, you can fully immerse yourself in sound all around you.Bluetooth specification version 5.3 wireless technology for unrestricted movement.\\nSLOSAP bluetooth headphones with built-in 400mAh battery,up to 20 hours of battery life for all day power after fully charged.USB type-C battery charge method, charging time about 2 hours.\\nDesigned to be lightweight and comfortable for all-day use,foldable design for compact and easy carrying.Adjustable headband makes it easy to fit all sizes heads without pains.Softer and more comfortable memory protein earmuffs protect your ears when use earphones for long time.\\nWireless heaphons with transmitter range up to 60 ft (20 m), included 3.5mm audio cable, the wireless headset over ear can be easily switched to wired mode when powers off.\\nSupports external TF card (micro sd card) and FM radio function.Crystal clear hands-free calling with built-in mic.'}\n",

The headphones have a nice charging base that they sit into which also helps keep the headphones stowed and easy to find for the next use. The charging base is also the transmitter that has to be connected to the source device by a headphone jack or a Red/White-RCA jack. I would have given it 5 stars if it was Bluetooth compatible. Another thing to consider is that some newer smart TV\\'s do not have either of these outputs available, my Samsung 60\" TV does not, so I would not be able to use these headphones with my TV if I wanted to.

This static is unbearable and ruins the experience. This, which sounds like a huge burden, doesn’t affect my rating. Within 5 minutes I discovered the solution; turn up the TV’s volume and only use the dial on the wireless headphones for slight changes.\\n\\nPausing a show and returning will turn off the headphones, a kind of sleep mode.

They sound almost identical to Airpods Max or Sony WX5000 or whatever they're called.\", 'The sound quality with these is great the bass is amazing, the noise cancelling works really well for background noise (and that’s coming from an autistic adult with sensory issues) they are pretty comfy and they don’t fall off my head or squeeze too hard, the controls were a little confusing at first bc the instructions aren’t clear but just look up a video on YouTube to help you and it works great. My only complaint is that every once and a while the sound will cut out for like half a second, I can’t figure out why it’s not often enough to bother me too much but it is kinda annoying. Please let me know if there’s any way I can fix this. Other than that great headphones for the price', \"These bargain headphones go way past my expectations. I bought them for traveling as an alternative to earbuds that get uncomfortable on long flights. The sound is way better than I expected and they are light and comfortable. However, the noise cancelation is astounding. I'm in my own world. On two flights, the attendant had to flag me to put up the seat and window shade for landing. I didn't hear a thing. This was in and out of Europe where people are polite. So I'm sure they were trying for some time without being disruptive. So funny to me, it's worth making this review.\\n\\nBargain brands like this really deliver.\", 'So what are the differences between the SE and non SE Sonoflow? Only thing I can tell is that LDAC is not a feature in the SE and some minor cosmetic changes. ANC seems the same, which puts it in-between Soundcore Q35 and Soundcore Space in effectiveness, overall slightly above average for this price point. Great buy at under $50.', 'They are near perfect, the mic isn’t great and it lacks a 3.5mm jack but personally I didn’t care about that. This headset overall though for music and content in general are 1000% better than expected, these sound better than my computer headphones pushing 32bit audio, they sound cleaner and more crisp, the battery life is next level. I don’t use them every day but I just charged them for the first time last week, that’s over a month and a half without a charge. Good work 1more top notch.', 'They have the best sound out of any headphone or bud for me. The only complaint I have is my outer ears get sore. And they are not sweet proof. If those things were correct you wouldn’t be able to buy a better set. You can’t sound wise. And I say that having a set of Bose the sound and bass quality is 0 to none. I listen to them 5-8 hours a day every day. Until I start to sweat 😓. But the are truly a awesome set. And we’ll worth the money bar none', 'I am not a audiophile but graduating in 69, most of what I listen to is Rock!

Its a promise.', 'Head phones will no pair ,customer service providers provide nothing in help …', 'En definitiva los mejores.\\n\\nNo tienen nada que envidiarle a la marca Sony, etc.(si no eres un audiofilo).

I listen to a lot of dubstep and other heavy bass music and these are not only comfy for long periods but sound great, 9 out of 10. 9 because they feel sort of flimsy and could break if I'm careless. I have Bluetooth earbuds that sound great too, but I don't like using them all the time like I do these.\", \"Very thicc earpads, but can feel pain for prolonged use probably since this is my first on ear. Weird build quality as there are 5 different plastic finishing but don't feel cheap. Decent sound.\", \"They sound as great as you might expect from Skull Candy earphones. I find on-ear headphones to be more comfortable than over ear headphones. So, I think these are comfortable. The midrange is scooped giving a pleasing bass and treble response. They're kind of flimsy though and the cord is only 4 ft long.\", 'For the price these are excellent headphones and a worthy candidate for \"daily driver.\" For me, these are computer/desk headphones. That is my use and that is probably how you should plan on using them as well. The cushions are very soft but the fit itself is on the firm side. Because the cushions are soft, they are nice and comfortable. Because the cushions are soft I\\'d be hesitant about getting too much sweat in them at the gym. They won\\'t fall off-- that\\'s not the issue-- but I\\'m guessing you don\\'t want to get the cushions wet. Are they durable? They sit at my desk. I thought about stuffing them in a \"getting too full\" backpack for a flight recently and I declined to do so. If you are really going to be putting them into very full bags maybe see if you can handle a pair in the store before making a decision. On the desk? As long as you aren\\'t yanking these things off you should be fine.\\n\\nSound review? This is hard because there is so much that goes into it. I\\'ll give it a shot. I can\\'t talk about leakage because I\\'m not usually around people when these are on. There is no noise cancelling but the fit and the pads do an okay job of getting rid of a lot of background noise. These replaced some Koss Porta-Pros and some old Sol headphones as my main laptop headphones. (That\\'s where I do most of my work.) So yes, I\\'m running off a laptop. No fancy power sources. They can get nice and loud and not bring in any distortion. That\\'s good. I guess these are probably \"somewhat warm\" sounding headphones. I listen to some vaporwave and a lot of metal (black/thrash and such) so I think I cover the need to hear all levels and ranges of sound and don\\'t have a need to focus on one aspect over the other but I guess the elephant in the room is always bass? It handles bass pretty well. It isn\\'t an overly aggressive bass sound but you can hear it nicely and distinctly. There is some punch to the bass but, to be sure, it isn\\'t at the level of beats headphones (and I like beats, but they are also a lot more money). Listening to some of the raw metal recordings, the bass is nice and it handles the distortion and rawness of metal tracks very well. So, the bass is good to the extent that the headphones generally maintain a consistent and clear sound-profile. And there is clearly more bass than more clear or neutral sounding headphones. It isn\\'t necessarily a bass heavy headphone but it is definitely bass capable. I can make the volume louder or softer without introducing any more distortion and I don\\'t have to listen to it loudly to \"hear\" the music.\\n\\nThese are very good headphones for the price. The four stars is because the headphone market is brutal and these are four star headphones, especially for the price. They are not magic value headphones that you would/could pay +$150 for, or something like that. That is, in my mind, going in to five star territory. For the price you will probably pay for these on this site, you are getting a really great pair of daily drivers and they are easy to recommend. I\\'m considering getting the (a) blue-tooth version of these.', 'Also nice that they can connect to your phone to play music.\\n\\nJokes aside, for the price point it is hard to beat the comfort, sound quality, and battery life here. I see a lot of people complaining about the “plastic-y” feeling but these are not $200+ headphones, and if you are expecting headphones that have better build then you are in the wrong price bracket. I will also mention these are the second set I owned. The previous model I had for 3+ years. These look and feel just about the same but with better battery. The durability is just fine', 'as per usual, skullcandy never disappoints. i\\'ve sworn by the jib series of earbuds for years and these headphones are just as high-quality as the in-ears. much like the jib headphones, they\\'re nice with the high-end but a little on the heavier side with low end. that\\'s not at all a minus for me. reminds me of the \"mega bass\" sony had for a while. the low end is not offensive at all but rather pleasant and fairly transparent.\\nthe cherry-on-top with these phones is the power they can handle. again, much like the jib earbuds, these phones can handle pretty much as much juice as your device is able to throw at it with no distortion. a phone won\\'t crank too much but i also tested them with a headphone amplifier and they blast!\\nthese headphones don\\'t have any noise-cancelling system but i generally avoid that anyway. they\\'re also not very quiet externally so if you\\'re blasting music, everyone around you will hear it, too. that may be a con for some but i only use these at home so no biggie.\\nthe only drawback for me is that they\\'re a little smaller than i expected (hand in the pic for scale reference), but that\\'s not at all a design flaw and not anything to bring it down from five stars.\\nthese headphones are great not just for the price but ESPECIALLY for the price. they perform every bit as well as anything you\\'d find in the $50-$100 range. if you\\'re looking for something for studio use, these are not for you as they\\'re made to sound good, not flat. but if you want to rattle your brain with clear, defined boomy sound, these are the ones!', \"I like the sound quality for audio recording and listening. Unfortunately, you get what you pay for - and the headband is flimsy and easily cracks and breaks. I won't be buying these again.\", \"Very practical.

I take them off and put them on easily 20-30 times a day. Sure, I've been gentle with them when taking them off/putting them on and hanging them on my desk, but I think everybody should take some care when doing that anyways.\\n\\nPros:\\n- Ear pads are SUPER soft and cushiony (also a con, read below).\\n- Sound quality is DECENT for such a cheap pair of headphones. I'm a bit of an audiophile and will often return headphones if they don't sound good (and trust me, a lot in this price range and even more expensive don't sound great).

Amazon shows a number of critical reviews dragging down the review score for these based on pairing/connectivity issues, but like many older bluetooth devices, this can be very device-dependent with newer phones/tablets being more reliable.\\n\\nI'm glad I gave these a shot since I personally had no issues pairing the Belkin headphones with my Google Pixel 6. I paired them once and now the Belkin headphones connect immediately when turned on and disconnect immediately when turned off. I have multiple other bluetooth headphones and speakers paired with my phone, and they each connect perfectly to my phone when turned on (although I never turn on more than one headphone/speaker at the same time).\\n\\nThese Belkin headphones fit great on my 6 year old daughter at the smallest setting. The headband has plenty of adjustment to the point where they could even stretch to fit my adult head, so they should continue to fit her well for years to come. One thing to note is that if you have larger teens, the thinner plastic in the headband becomes unsheathed when extended and I could see that being less durable. But at the smallest setting, these feel pretty sturdy, especially in light of how affordable they are.\\n\\nSound quality and battery life are both more than acceptable for the price point and intended use for kids. My daughter thinks they are clear sounding and told me several times she appreciates how she can better hear the words in her favorite songs. She uses the headphones mostly for longer car rides, so I haven't been able to confirm whether it achieves the quoted battery life, but it is plenty long enough for our needs.\\n\\nLast thing to note: I suspect that the listening protection/maximum volume of 85 dB is for bluetooth only. I wanted to buy a bluetooth headphone that also can connect via wired since my daughter can use it when playing our keyboard/digital piano. However, when plugged in to our keyboard at full volume, these Belkin headphones get noticeably louder than they do over bluetooth. So if you're going to have your kids use these wired, consider supervising or monitoring the volume to avoid hearing damage!\", 'Bought these for traveling by with my 18month old. So far we have used them several times. Sound quality is pretty good for the price, they are lightweight and comfortable. Connectivity is good, easy to pair. Not sure about battery life as we have only used them for a few minutes at a time but they feel sturdy even though they are not heavy. I am very pleased with these as travel headphones for my girl so far.', \"My kod is 1.5yrs old and this fits great at the smallest setting. Being his first headphones we didn't want to drop $100 on a pair. The $20 JLabs looked like it would be too big so we opted for these Belkins. The sound quality is as expected for the price range. When maxed out it didn't seem as loud as standard headphones. I could barely hear them at listening volume when they were sitting on the coffee table.\\n\\nOn the first go, the tike kept them on for over 5 minutes. Whether it was the allure of Vivo or not, it was comfortable enough to not be bothered. He has since gotten more used to it. Hopefully, 2 months is long enough for him to enjoy having them on or else that 5hr flight is gonna be rough...\\n\\nPairing them is very simple. I do not like how you cannot enter a pairing mode with a long press. Regardless of device, it needs to be unpaired before you can pair it to another device.\\n\\nCan't speak on the battery life too much since the kid hasn't used it enough to warrant a recharge. That being said, he's used it for at least 1 hr - longer if you include standby mode.\", \"These headphones deliver good sound quality, pack a flexible microphone, provide protection from high volume levels, can be both wired-or-Bluetooth, and if that's not enough, they have a 3.5mm out for sharing.

I am happy to say that I really like these a lot.\\n\\nOn the plus side, these come well-packaged with good, easy-to-follow instructions. It’s very easy to pair with my Kindle and my tablet and cell phones. They are also easy to store in a protective zippered case and they charge up quickly with different charging cables. They hold a charge for a long time.\\n\\nWhat makes these extra-nice is the sound quality - it is rich and immersive. I often have an issue with the quality of the bass but not with these; there is a simple sliding bass adjuster with which you can control the bass but even pulled all the way down they sounded great. I have attached some photos which show you the sliding adjuster and know it’s easy to reach all the controls with your hands while the headphones are on.\\n\\nThe only critique I have is that I found the headphones to be a little uncomfortable if worn for any length of time. My husband did not have this issue with these and he has declared that these headphones are for him.\\n\\nRecommended with the one issue above.', \"I haven't gotten to use these much but the little time I have I am in love with them. Most buy them for the ability to increase the bass but for me it was the opposite! I had a pair years ago that you could adjust the bass on and they helped tremendously with the headaches I get from the bass, so far since I can turn the bass all the way down on the earphone it is helping too. They connected easily to my laptop the first time and every time I have used them. As I said I have the bass turned all the way down so I cannot comment on that but otherwise the sound quality is great!\", \"The Crushers are a meme. They have been for years and I did try the originals and they were pretty terrible. I saw these pop up and decided to give them a shot.\\n\\nThe Bluetooth connection seems great and I've had zero dropouts but there is also a pretty hefty amount of latency, definitely more than enough to ruin lip sync. The wired connection is much better, but I am also plugging it into a ~$20k audio chain so it's kind of being carried by that but even being wired at all totally eliminates the latency so it's a win in my books.\\n\\nIsolation is actually quite poor for a closed back. It really doesn't block out much outside noise at all, but it's not that bad when actually listening to things and conversely, it leaks a LOT of noise to the people around you like a semi-open set.\\n\\nComfort is honestly great, but I do wish that there was more space inside the cups, my ears basically touch the pads all the way around.\\n\\nThe sound quality overall is about average, and tuning is fairly neutral with what seems to be a bit of rolled off treble so detail does suffer quite a bit, but using the AutoEQ (everyone has free access to EQ whether it be on PC or mobile and if you own these and aren't using it, you wasted your money) preset for the Crusher Evo does make them DRASTICALLY more capable. The haptic bass is hilarious. It's fun, but it is also basically pointless above around 10% of the slider, any more than that and it just exclusively takes away from all performance and sound quality. Is it funny to crank it to max and listen to bassy tracks or action movies? Yes. Does it sound good or add anything positive? Absolutely not. That being said, the tactile feel of having it around 5-10% is actually pretty cool and I do like it.\\n\\nIn stock form without EQ and with the Bluetooth latency taken into consideration, these are a firm 3 star. With EQ and hard wired, I'd put them closer to 4 stars. Price wise, these are a $100 headphone and the listing I got them from had them at a $199.99 price and is now at $179.99 and at that price, these are a total joke and in no way worth that asking price. They aren't worth a single cent over $100 and in my opinion should be closer to $75 solely because of the fairly unique haptic bass. If Skullcandy could tone down the haptic bass to a more usable range and cap out around 15% of the total but retain the whole sweep for finer adjustment and get the stock tuning in line with something closer to Harman (again, EQ is free and can accomplish this), these would be a great buy at $100 for someone wanting something fun and engaging. The Bluetooth latency is probably a thing of the past seeing as that these are a few years old and Bluetooth codecs nowadays are much better so the newer models most likely don't suffer from this nearly as much, but I can't say for sure. Overall decent product just a bit overpriced and needs some help to perform where they should.\", \"The sound quality is great with everything coming through clearly, the bass was fantastic. One thing that effects the sound quality is the positioning of the headphones because they do not fully envelope the ears and may press on and block some of the ears. This also effects the noise canceling a little. Because they are on ear a little they can get a little uncomfortable over time but expect this will vary depending on the person and the size of their head and ears. As with any headphones the controls take a little getting used to and these are the same. Don't have a good idea about the battery life yet, will update when I do. Really like the looks and build of these.\", 'In my experience Skullcandy always delivers. This headset is easy to use, easy to take with you and the case keeps is safe when you’re not using it. It has good battery life and charges fast. I love that you can easily control the bass level. These aren’t as awesome at noise cancelation as my AirPod Max headphones, and they don’t have quite the same sound quality, but I don’t like to travel with those, because they are so expensive. These Skullcandy headphones are affordable, have great sound and travel well. They are also great for keeping in your bag, so you always have a pair of headphones with you.', 'Still not better than AirPods, but given its price and branding for skull candy, it’s a pretty mid range basic headset that could last you a while. Probably the best for vacations if you don’t want to worry about losing expensive or valuable items', 'Exactly as described I love the sound quality it comes with everything you need'], 'detail': \"Skullcandy Crusher Evo Over-Ear Wireless Headphones Bundle with Protective Case and USB-C Cable - Skullcandy Headphones Wireless Bluetooth with Adjustable Haptic Sensory Bass, 40 Hr Battery (Black) SKULLCANDY WIRELESS HEADPHONES BUNDLE.

Beyond that they still sound as good as they did when I bought them sometime in 2022. I use these in the gym, at work, at school and the noise cancellation alone is great. I will say it’s not completely noise cancelling when there is no music but honestly as a woman I greatly appreciate that, not being able to hear on a walk or run sometimes can be a little dangerous when you are used to somewhat relying on hearing the world around you for safety. The battery also lasts really long, I charge these probably once a week and just to put that into perspective for some people I’m in the top 5% of Spotify users, I’m alwaysssssss listening to something with these. The ear pieces rotate and fold in which is nice for when you put them in a bag or something which it does come with a pretty nice pouch, I do with it was a hard shell pouch just for a little more safety but like I said they should’ve broken so many times and they just simply haven’t so I kind of understand. I also think it was cute that it came with a pink charger and aux cord that’s a nice touch Fr. If the bag woulda been pink too??? Ooooo extra extra credit dawg. I really expected these to be okay but they are great especially for the price, these have held up better than a lot of my more expensive headphones in the past. The ear pads are also very comfortable not too soft but also not too hard and the music is louuuud like with these I can listen on 1/3 the volume I would on earbuds. I will say half volume or more the odds of innocent bystanders hearing your music is decently high. Anyways love these 10/10 recommend', \"I bought these about a year ago, and they work really well. Comfortable, good sound, long battery life, easy to use. But about a month ago part of the plastic on the headband broke, so when I'm wearing them, they don't stay in place very well. Even though I had no paperwork, figuring that most electronic items have a one year warranty, I contacted the seller and told them the problem. I included a copy of the invoice, and the replied very quickly that the warranty was still valid, and all they needed was my name and address and they could send me a replacement. I thought I would have to send the broken one back, but no. Less then two weeks later I received the replacement, and it works just like it's supposed to. So I'm very happy with both the headphones and the company.\", \"I've been using these headphones for six weeks and my verdict is in: they're excellent. They really get the job done at a surprisingly low price. I bought them because my gym was driving me nuts. They blast the music way too loud, and while 99% of the people working out are wearing their own headphones. Why do they do it? I HAVE NO IDEA.\\n\\nI listen to Audible novels in the gym. I can't stand ear buds, and my trusty old lightweight on-the-ear headphones let way too much noise in, even when I'd crank the volume all the way up, which made me worry about hearing damage. So I decided to try over-the-ear buckets with noise cancellation. I was skeptical that this model would be decent at such a low price, but I was wrong. Here's what I discovered:\\n\\nComfort: very comfortable. Even after 90 minutes I have no trace of head or ear fatigue. They're just plain comfy. And they're snug enough that they do not shift at all during my workouts.\\n\\nSound quality: I'm no expert but it seems perfect for music and audio books.\\n\\nNoise cancellation: WOW! I'd never tried noise cancellation before and it's amazing. Put them on and click the noise cancellation button and suddenly it feels like a dome of silence was lowered around you. I kept turning off the button and partially removing the headphones just to verify the difference and wow, very cool. Almost all of the cacophony of the gym is greatly diminished -- all of the machines, banging weights, treadmills and everything seem to disappear. Same on an airplane. Same at my doctor's office waiting room when I sat next to some kind of noisy dehumidifier -- I pressed the button and the noise from the machine literally disappeared. Blew my mind.\\n\\nThe only problem and why I give it 4.5 stars instead of 5: In the gym, most of the background noise goes away, and same with the blasting music bass sounds and instruments, all gone -- however, the music VOCALS are still there. But they are reduced a decent amount. I'd say reduced from a 10 to a 5, whereas the other noises are reduced to a 2 or 1 or even zero. So I can still hear the vocals, but it's not distracting and my audio book is easily heard.\\n\\nSo given all that, this is a great product that I'd buy again. Very impressive!\\n\\nUPDATE: after writing this review I wondered why the noise cancelling was not very effective with vocals. So I googled some articles and learned that even the most expensive noise cancelling headphones do not do well with reducing human speech, because it is at a frequency that is too high, whereas current noise cancelling technology is most effective at lower frequencies. Bottom line: it's a weakness with all models of noise cancelling headphones!\", 'I’ve used these for maybe 5 months now and throughout my first semester of college. The battery lasts like 3-5 days sometimes more and that’s counting walking all around campus, using them in the gym, studying, etc. They are very noise cancelling especially with the AMC filter. Not too bulky but also big enough because I don’t like small headphones. They’re super cute and honestly amazing for only $50. Way better than spending 200+ on beats or AirPod maxes. They can feel a little tight sometimes when you wear them for too long but it’s never really been an issue for me. And I can use them when talking on the phone and people can hear me well. Definitely recommend.', 'Ordered this for a 14 hour drive at the start of the year and it is still extremely high quality and functioning. Don’t gota waist $100 of dollars on name brand really good noise canceling and buttons make it easy to adjust the audio'], 'detail': \"HROEENOI Active Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Over-Ear Headphones, Memory Foam Ear Cups, Quick Charge for 40H Playtime, Ideal for Travel, Home Office, Gym Workouts Sliver 🎶 Superior Sound with aptX Technology: With HROEENOI's headphones, experience music like never before.

This makes for easy peasy cleaning, and the adjustment is as simple as using your finger to move around the round speaker so that it is perfectly situated on your ear, or wherever you like.\\n*The speakers do not in any way hurt my head or ear, and I sleep on my sides.\\n*The volume is perfect for me, I listen to sleep hypnosis podcasts at night. I do not want or need anything to be noise canceling while I sleep, I need to have some awareness if a boogeyman is in the kitchen at 3 a.m. doing my dishes loudly.\\n*If you turn it on but don't use it for 5 minutes it shuts itself off, to save the battery life.\\nI only have one con and it doesn't bother me in the slightest, but I see where it could be annoying to someone's sleeping partner. The blinking LED light when you are using it is really bright and invasive, especially if you are sleeping near someone else's face.\\nOverall Fantastic purchase especially for the price, I would recommend :)\", 'Es fácil de usar y cuando duermes es cómodo solo ajustalo cuando lo uses', '', \"I am pleasantly surprised with this !\\nI listen to meditation or music to fall asleep or when I wake up in the middle of the night, and using earbuds was just uncomfortable on my side.

The comfortable, breathable design, adjustable headphones, and Bluetooth connectivity make it a must-have for anyone who struggles with falling asleep or staying asleep.\", 'The mask was bought with the intention to listen to some soothing recordings from my Fire Kindle while falling a sleep. It did the job. The mask sat on my nose comfortably and blocked almost all the light apart of one little imperfection of the side of my nose.\\n\\nI do however have notes to add: Should the mask have a timer on it to turn off after a set time, that would have been superb. The speakers can be heard by others in the room. Should they be earbuds although wired that would be more convenient and private.\\n\\nOn a lighter note, If I may make a suggestion and be rewarded with shares for its sale. The mask could have vivid coloured lights inside and in front of the eyes, which are electronically synchronised with the sound. Of course they will have to be controllable, on and off. They can then be used with light meditation and Yoga. An app on the phone or tablet could be designed and programmed to enable functions for the mask.

I like to relax waiting for my appointments. This allows me to listen to my tunes at my leisure. It doesn’t hurt your ears. I can comfortably sleep on my side without compromising the sound quality. Let’s not forget how fashionable it looks. I got the butterfly pattern. It is definitely worth the price. I am mostly likely order another one so if it needs to be cleaned, I don’t have to wait to enjoy it.', \"I've been using this headband for about a week. My experience has been mostly positive.\\n\\nReading the reviews, I expected the earpieces to be a little uncomfortable when laying down. While I can certainly feel them, they are very round with no pokey edges, and the fabric is comfortable, so paired with a soft pillow, I have no trouble sleeping on my side. The ear pieces are in a long pocket. if you wear the headband as it comes, the ear pieces will likely be too far back for you. This is good, I think, since it allows for different people to adjust the location of the pieces to their liking. With a little finagling, you can get the speakers in place to your liking. If you really don't want them to shift as you wear them (which has not been a bother for me) you could get out your sewing kit and add a couple stitches behind the speaker, or around it as you like.\\nI will say that sleeping on my back is a little annoying, as the seam hits me at the nape of the neck. This will probably be more annoying for persons with shorter hair, but even people with longer hair like me may not find this too comfortable. I get by with a little adjusting.\\nI don't find the front control to be uncomfortable in any way, but you can feel it being there, so be mindful of that.\\nThe material is very soft, and is thin. I find it very comfortable. It does ride up a bit on my head with wear, even when I'm not sleeping. I find myself adjusting it back down to my ears every so often. This doesn't bother me, but it's worth noting. because it rides up, it makes my hair look really dumb. I am not likely to wear this in front of anyone I want to impress for this reason, and because of the front control panel. It is very comfortable as an eye mask when I sleep.\\nIt falls off as I sleep in it overnight. This is not an issue for me as I only use it to go to sleep, not to stay asleep. It is easy for me to find in the morning, unlike the bluetooth corded ear buds I used to use, which I have lost.\\nI use this headband to listen to 20 minute stories as I go to sleep, which helps me ignore my snoring roommate. I used to have trouble falling asleep to snoring, but while I can still technically hear the snoring, I have had no such trouble since trying this product.\\nIt charges pretty fast. I was very surprised on the first charge when it seemed to fill up in a matter of minutes. I wonder if it was pre-charged when it arrived. I have not drained the battery much, since then and I charge it every day. I don't use the audio feature all night long. I only use these headphones for 20 minute stories to go to sleep to, and sometimes to listen to Youtube videos while my roommate sleeps, which is sometimes an hour or two. The battery life has never gone as low as halfway, and usually not very low at all.\\nThe speakers seem to work perfectly for my needs. I'm not audiophile, but I seem to hear my videos as clearly as any other headphones or through my phone's native speaker, which is all I ask.\\nThis was the perfect solution for me.\", 'I bought these to use while walking or at the gym. I have now added wearing them to the laundromat while washing clothes. I have also slept with them. I even wore them to Walmart to do grocery shopping.\\n\\nComfort - They are very comfortable.\\nNoise Cancellation - They are not noise cancelling but I want to be able to hear what is going on around me so that was a good thing. Five stars on this feature simply because it did not cancel the noise and that is what I was looking for. Five stars because I did not want noise cancelling and I got what I wanted.\\nSound quality - For what I use them for the sound was fine. I listen to audiobooks/podcasts and stream movies so my only requirement is that the voices are clear. Five stars on this feature because again it worked for me.\\nVolume Control - The control buttons are good. There are 3 buttons and they protrude a bit. If I need to power them on and off I just feel for the center button and long press it. The up and down buttons are on either side of the power button. It is easy for me to find them by feel.\\nBattery - While I was using them only 2 or 3 hours a day the battery lasted multiple days before charging them. I now charge them daily due to using them to sleep (see my notes for sleep below).\\nSleeping - The only thing I want to note is, if you intend to use them for sleep, make sure to keep them charged daily. The reason for this is there is a loud voice the proclaims \"LOW BATTERY\" and it is LOUD. Even when the speaker volume is low the voice is LOUD. Charging them every morning will prevent this from being a problem. A full charge lasts all night.\\nMovement - While walking around or biking I do not find that they move around much. The headband stays in place. Sometimes the speakers will shift a bit but it is just a matter of reaching up and sliding the speaker back into place. There is no need to adjust the entire band. Now sleeping is a different matter. They usually do not stay in place at night. I usually wake up in the morning with them either completely off or just around my forehead (think 80s aerobics videos). This is fine for me. I mostly use them to help me fall asleep. Also, I am a restless sleeper. I toss and turn A LOT. They may stay in place better for someone who moves around less.\\nCleaning - Cleaning is easy. I do sweat a good bit when walking so they get sweaty. I remove the electronics and put them in the washer (cold water) and let them air dry. It can be a bit time consuming to put the electronics back in but it is not too bad.\\nDurability - I have owned this pair for over a year. I bought them June 2022 and this review is being written August 2023. In this time I have noticed no change in their function. I am, in fact, planning to buy a second pair for rotation while one pair is in laundry.\\n\\nOverall rating of four stars. Deducted one star for the awkward \"LOW BATTERY\" notification. They are listed as \"sleep\" in the description but that voice could wake up light sleepers.', 'This is a weird review, but hopefully it can help someone as it has me. This is a great product and works for all the expected uses. But, when I had a recent asthma exacerbation and I just could NOT sleep when hearing myself wheeze, this device helped. Earplugs help when someone ELSE was making sleeping noises, snoring, etc, but only amplified my own breathing noises. Everytime I hear myself wheeze, I feel the need to reposition or cough so…no sleep for me. I tried regular earbuds but they aren’t comfortable or practical for a full night sleep. THEN, I tried this earbud headband. Very comfortable. I found a thunder/rainstorm sleep track on YouTube with noises that are similar to wheezes and rhonchi…and suddenly I lost my own breathing noises in the background noise. First good nights sleep in weeks…As I continue to get past this current illness this headband will remain my go to!', 'Me gusto mucho la tela que es muy suave y de buena apariencia, ademas que es super cómoda para dormir porque no molestan para nada los auriculares.

Some were uncomfortable. Some had static, Some were dumb and if you went to do something like adjust volume it they would hang up on the person you were talking to… so I went into this purchase with the thought that they would last for a bit and then I’d be done. I love them!!! I can’t believe how affordable they were, they are comfortable, the sound is phenomenal. The quality and build of the product is long lasting plus the nice little storage case helps! Connecting to devices was simple and now they connect whenever I use them. Other devices I had to pair and impair to get to work,.. these know they are paired!!', 'These are amazing. Solid sound, great connectivity, super cute, and the price is hard to beat. In love with these headphones.', 'These headphones are pretty good for their price! They lasted me about a year and are pretty sturdy. They feel comfortable on your ears but the noise-cancelling is not that great. Additionally, the sound quality is decent but hollow at times.

This is the first accessory she has had this long without damage. She takes then everywhere. She loves that they still work with a cord if the battery dies.

They have a case as well, nice feature.\\nShe loves the sound and the charge time is remarkable.\\nVery pleased with these and the price tag.\", \"I purchased these for long haul flights - earbuds will give me a headache with extended use.

Worked perfectly for my flight.\", \"They work pretty good and sound quality seems pretty good. The only thing I dislike is there is an odd noise when no music is playing.

I won't return them though because otherwise they work good and were very affordable.\", \"So I've been using these headphones for over a month now, and what I did notice about it is that with bluetooth audio is delayed, but with the jack cord it is not, now i don't mind it when it comes to music, because i'm not worried about the timing of it.

I wasn\\'t sure what to expect from the price, but so far I really like them!\\n\\nPros:\\n- Clear sound quality! I read lots of reviews that the bass was a little much, but I don\\'t think it\\'s bad. There is a button on the left ear that you can use to change the sound settings, so if the default setting isn\\'t good for you, see if one of the other 5 settings works better!\\n- Easy set up\\n- Stays put on your head. I put these on and did a quick yoga flow with a few down dogs and it barely budged. If you need these for some kind of physical activity, it seems like they aren\\'t going to be needing constant readjustment.\\n- Decently noise canceling. While you can still hear a bit of what is going on around you, these seem to do a decent job of limiting extraneous sound. And they do a great job of containing the media sound withing the headphone - I put them in my lap and played music and couldn\\'t hear it! No need to worry about bothering someone next to you.\\n- Easy to adjust length\\n-Decently comfortable. I tend to have pretty sensitive ears when it comes to headphones/earbuds, so not immediately feeling like my ears are being smashed is important to me. I will update after I have had an opportunity to wear them for a long time (1+ hour) but I\\'ve had them on for about 30 minutes and still feel comfortable with them on which is a good sign.\\n\\nCons:\\n- The plastic exterior just felt a bit low quality to me at first. When I pulled them out of the box I wasn\\'t sure how well they would work because they just felt kind of cheap. They\\'re really pretty though, and lightweight, so I don\\'t really think this is a big deal, especially given the price!!\\n- The joints where the ear pieces can fold in to compact just feel a bit stiff, and I am a little concerned about how many times I\\'ll be able to fold/unfold them before something breaks. For now there aren\\'t any issues, but I\\'m keeping my eye on it.\\n- It\\'s kind of tricky to control the volume on the actual headset. I have sensitive hearing so I have only been using the lowest possible volume setting and it is plenty, but if I need to toggle up or down it\\'s definitely easier to do on my device. The press and hold system on the ear piece doesn\\'t allow for as much control in the margin of increase/decrease in volume. Not a huge issue, but an area that could use improvement for sure.', \"I've been looking for a good pair of wireless headphones on a budget price ever since Apple decided to remove the 3.5mm jack from their phones, with every phone company following suit. So now I'm forced to listen to wireless products. However, the cool thing about these headphones is it CAN be wired, which I love.\\n\\nThe sound quality is amazing for the price. It blows my wireless earbuds out of the water in terms out sound, from vocal clarity to bass to every little sound that goes into the song. They can get quite loud and powerful. The noise cancelation also seems to work quite well.\\n\\nI've been wearing these pretty much non-stop since they arrived. They're pretty light but also decently durable for the price, so you really can't tell you've got them on. The battery life is amazing I can wear them for ages without charging, I think I've only charged them once in the past few days since they arrived.\\n\\nAnother really cool feature is the buttons on side, power on/off, volume up/down, some sort of EQ mode button that allows you to switch between different pre-sets to make specific music you're listening to feel deeper, and you start to notice more sounds.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, there's probably way better wireless headphones in the market, but for this price (I paid $19.28) they are absolutely amazing and I might pick up a few more pairs in case one ever breaks for some reason.\\n\\nIf you're reading this review and still hesitating snagging a pair of these and they're in the $20ish range. Snag 'em up. They're fantastic and I'm very pleased with the quality, comfort, and durability of these wireless headphones for the price.\\n\\nSide notes: It also has an FM feature which I haven't tested much, but that's unique and cool. Useful if you enjoy listening to certain radio shows. The microphone for phone calls seems to be quality, and of course I can hear the calls crystal clear.\\n\\nI'm sure I'm missing a few things, but overall I'd rate these a 10/10 based off all the factors I listed above. Give them a try you won't be disappointed!\\n\\nP.S. I LOVE the gold and black color. It looks incredible. Buy these. They're awesome. You're welcome, now go enjoy some tunes.\", \"I bought these last April 2022. They recently broke because I took them off my head at a weird angle and so they broke. Even though they broke it still functions. Prior to that I had dropped them plenty of times over the year I had them and they did not break. So, they're durable. I was able to tape it together but I'll need to get a new one regardless because it doesn't fit on my head the same. The sound quality is good for headphones that are $20. However, the mic quality is absolute shit, so make sure you have an external microphone you can use. The volume controls are decent but I typically set my volumes using my PC settings. I've used them for work from home, meetings, and even for playing games. The battery life is good too and they work while plugged in and charging. I also like that they'll automatically shut off when not in use. Overall, definitely good for the price. I'd recommend it.\", 'OMG I CANT SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THESE!! THEY ARE LOUD, NOISE CANCELLING, THEY CONNECT QUICKLY AND THE BATTERY LIFE IS CRAZY!! I WILL BE BUYING MORE OF THESE!! THEY ARE JUST AS GOOD AS BEATS!! GREAT FOR WORKING OUT, LISTENING TO AUDIO BOOKS AND PODCAST. GET SOME!!! THEY CHARGE FAST, C TYPE CHARGER AND THEY COME WITH A 3MM JACK FOR PLUGGING DIRECTLY INTO YOUR PHONE IF YOU NEED TO.

It is good headphones for a budget. These are great to travel with. Compared to many other wireless headphone, these are over the ear headphones. The headphone does have a microphone built in. It does come with both Bluetooth and aux connection if you want to do it that way. That being said they can work for laptop, tablets, desktops, and phones given they have Bluetooth capability or 3.5 headphone jack. The headphones are fairly decent size. They are not extremely heavy so it is great to walk with. There is a simple bag carrying case with a pull string to close the bag. You can control the sound and such on the actual device or your phone. There are LED light indicators to show charging as well. From what I can tell, you can use an aux port even with the device's battery is dead. It utilizes a PU leather and foam for the ear cushions. With this material, you can expect the material as some irritation to your skin if you sweat. For best cleaning, I would just wipe it down with a damp towel or an alcohol wipe. It is a simple press button. It does utilize type c charging which is nice. I do not think it can connect it wired to use the headphone The type c cable provided is pretty long. The headphone fits nicely and comfort. It does take a few uses to break in the leather material and be comfortable putting these headphones on. Like a pair of shoes, you have got to break the headphones in for they are easier to fit on your head. The head piece can also be adjusted on the ends. One thing to note about this is that it does get warm to wear this during hot days. It can rub against your skin if you happen to sweat. It can cause irritation. It does not pinch too much on my ears so it will not crush my ear into my glasses which is nice. It uses the USB cable charging purposes. The sound quality is really good as well I am able to use this headphones with my VR headset and the sound is amazing. It feels like I am sitting in the room as it has surround sound. All controls for these headphones on the left side. You can mute/unmute. The microphone definitely picks up my voice very easily and clearly. It blocks out a good amount of surrounding noise for something without a wind guard. The device is also very easy to adjust in my opinion to make it definitely feel very comfortable. The black and red color is nice. I would say if you can just to wipe it down with those lint catchers to get rid of hair and just wipes with an alcohol after use. It is very easily fitting to any head with the adjustment. There is no dongle so you need to connect this via bluetooth or you can use aux cable. Overall these are inexpensive headphones that are good quality for the budget. The sound is good and it has the basic features many other headphones of this size haven. It does make gaming on your phone an experience though which is great. I do like that you can use both aux and bluetooth.\", '', '', \"We wanted wireless headphones for our travel needs. This headphone does the job very well. Not the best-sounding ones as high-end headphones but good enough at this price point. Overall it has a good capability & we (My wife & I) are satisfied with it for the price factor. I would recommend it.\\n\\nMy 2 cents below:\\n\\nPros:\\n- Sound is good & clear enough. Seals the ear well & noise-canceling features work nicely. I like the bass in these too\\n- Microphone works great in office calls & no one has complained yet who listens to me on those calls\\n- Comfortable to wear & use these even for long periods of time. The padding is soft & headband/earmuffs are adjustable too\\n- 50 hours of playback time is the above market standard for similar headphones\\n- The controls on the headphones are easy to get used to it\\n- Design is classy & modern looking\\n- Build quality is very good overall & feels durable\\n- They bundled a carry bag in the package\\n- Reasonably priced when compared to the competitive options available\\n\\nCons:\\n- It is not the best-sounding headphones as high-end Sony or Bose etc but it's not fair to compare it with those high-end headphones too\", 'Used these on the plane for a few hours at a time for each connecting flight. They sit comfortably on my large head, due to the soft pads all around and the adjustable length of the ear cups. I was able to use them both wired through the plane’s entertainment system and wirelessly with my iPhone X. Both methods work well and did not vary in sound quality that I could notice. Overall sound quality is decent considering the price bracket these fall into. Yes, there are better but more expensive headphones. But these hit a sweet spot of price, comfort and satisfying sound quality. These ANC8 don’t have too much bass, so some heavy bass songs do distort a bit at high volume. The overall sound quality is fairly good and crisp. Although worth the price, these can’t compete head to head with models that are priced twice as much or more.\\n\\nThe multi-function buttons work well. They are large and easy to find and control while the headphones are on my head. Power, Volume, Track and Noise Cancellation are all a press away. The Bluetooth pairing to my iPhone X was simple following the included instructions. There are different color LEDs indicating if the headphones are on and/or connected to BT. I like that the volume on these adjusts both on the headphones and on my iPhone at the same time. Some devices have separate adjustment levels which can be annoying. I also like that the battery level / indicator (for the headphones) is displayed on my phone. The noise cancellation works fairly well. Again, it doesn’t stack up to the “known” expensive units (yes, I’ve tried a few), but these do perform well enough for their price bracket. On the plane they did help me sleep and reduced the annoying loud engine hum, so I’m glad I took these with me. I charged these at my destination only to top them off. But there was no indication of battery shortage during my 9+ hours of use each way.\\n\\nThese ANC8 headphones came with a rigid black zip-up carry case and two cables. One 62” audio cable and the other 34” micro USB for charging. The included manual is simple, detailed and translated to a few languages. Overall, these are decent Noise Cancelling headphones that are worth the sixty buck$.', 'Got these as a second pair for workout. Loved the color and design and fits perfectly. The sound is great and makes working out enjoyable. The best part is that I used them after 7 days without charging and they still work. I was convinced it would need charging but I was surprised it worked fine. Totally worth the cost!', 'Good sound not a lot of bass tbh ear muffs are a little small and the sound canceling doesn’t work', 'Great product, worth the price.', 'Decent sound and better quality bass......\\nNoise cancellation also superb....', '6 weeks into owning these the war cover fell off and cannot be attached'], 'detail': 'AUSDOM E7 Bluetooth Noise Cancelling Headphones: Wireless Over Ear ANC Headphones with Microphone, 50H Playtime, Hi-Fi Stereo Sound, Deep Bass, Comfortable Protein Earpads for Travel Work Home Office Digital Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) Technology: Advanced ANC technology Utilizes sophisticated algorithms to analyze incoming sound signals and generate a precise \"anti-noise\" signal that effectively neutralizes unwanted ambient noise.

It reduces the pain that is caused by standard headphones and earbuds, which may generate pressure points and make it difficult to sleep on one's side. Those individuals who like sleeping on their side while listening to their preferred music or other audio material will find that this headband is a game-changer. These headphones for sleeping deliver an impressively high-quality sound experience overall. The speakers that are built into the headband provide sound that is both clear and well-balanced, which enables me to listen to my preferred music, audiobooks, or podcasts with an amazing level of clarity. The positioning of the speakers has been carefully thought out to match the ears, which will provide the listener with the best possible audio experience without creating any pain or getting in the way.

I ordered a third one as a gift for a sports coach and when it came the box said it was just for sleep. So which is it? Can it be used for both?

If you enjoy falling asleep to music, these headphones are a game-changer for a restful night's sleep.\", 'Comfortable, soft, headphones have good sound & great volume control. Easy to pair w/ my phone.\\nBlocks out sounds & light if I pull them down over my eyes.\\nLooks good too.', 'A headband with great qualities held back by terrible design choices. As we enter into the age of artificial intelligence, part of me feels a really smart robot was given a description of what a good sleep headband should have and made it, but no humans QA tested it.\\n\\n______\\nPROS:\\n- Great sound for coin-sized speakers. For years, I used normal-sized headphones to help me sleep. I see some people are complaining about the size and/or shape of these speakers, but my seasoned ears found them acceptable. At least until the technology improves, however it does.\\n\\n- Easy enough Bluetooth connection. Took me a moment, but I\\'m not sure if the initial instructions were vague or it was my user error, but now that I know, the headphones readily and easily connect to my smartphone.\\n\\n- Breathable fabric. I am neither the most or least sweaty person, and my skin feels fine under the headband.\\n______\\nCONS:\\n- Terrible, terrible, terrible volume control. The \"-\" and \"+\" buttons on the headband have two functions: track/playlist navigation by *tapping* either button, and controlling the volume by *holding* either button. All that would need to be done is switch these input functionalities around, so that holding a button switches tracks (after which it waits for you to release and hold again, as you will need a second regardless to hear what track you\\'re on), and tapping it changes volume. A design flaw made much worse by:\\n\\n- There\\'s a horribly loud and painful beep after you set either the headband or connected device to max volume, and I do mean LOUD. Not loud because everything else it\\'s quiet, it\\'s LOUD. Such a design could only mean that the software in my specific item is horribly bugged, or no one actually tested or cared about this terrible feature in the software (or something else that I hope their software engineer could explain to me). Normally, you shouldn\\'t be listening to headphones at max volume, but if you lose the game of trying to turn up the volume of quiet music by holding down the button and accidentally and unwantingly setting it to max volume, you\\'ll be punished with most unpleasant screech in your ears.\\n\\n- Flashing lights? At one point, the red and blue lights on front that normally dictate the headband connecting flashed without stopping, lighting up the dark room. I ended up ditching them and using my old, standard-sized, uncomfortable headphones I was looking to replace with this product. After recharging/turning them on-and-off again, the lights stopped. However, the battery was at 80% power when the lights started, so I\\'m not sure what the issue was.\\n_______________\\nSMALLER CONS:\\n- I see some people have been complaining about the \"Connected\" voice. Specifically for me, it\\'s not been an issue as I connect my headband before I put it on, but I can see why that it a bad design choice if your device turns on or off automatically.\\n\\n- While the headband is light and small, the buttons have a bad habit of being pressed if you like to sleep on your side/downward. More of an issue with buttons and people in bed, and I wouldn\\'t point to this as a deal-breaker. HOWEVER, considering holding down \"+\" increases volume, expect to be woken up by that loud beep if you lean too far on your left side, or if it falls off your head and you roll onto it as it has with me.\\n\\n- The positions of the speakers can be adjusted slightly to fit where my ears are. However, the band itself is somewhat awkwardly shaped. There isn\\'t really a position for the band itself to rest on the forehead without the speakers completely missing the ears. So, you have to wear it more on your brow. While I get these could double to cover your eyes, they don\\'t cover my eyes comfortably either. While I wouldn\\'t say they torture you, this will be a headband that you will be aware that you are wearing.\\n\\n- No noise cancellation. (Didn\\'t buy it for, nor expected it to block noise. Just feels misleading to market it as such.)\\n\\n_____________\\nOverall, I\\'d rate this three stars. Not three stars of a mediocre product, but a product of laughably bad design that I begrudgingly use for certain good qualities. I will only use this for as long as until I can find a better headband that was actually quality assured, which I hope will be soon. I need some sleep.', \"I bought this item because I enjoy listening to podcasts before I fall asleep. As a side sleeper, using my AirPods was uncomfortable—they'd press against my eardrum. But these headphones are different. The moment I put them on, I noticed how soft and stretchy the headband felt. It's like a workout headband, but with padded earphones inside. Surprisingly, the audio is loud and crystal clear. Initially, I even thought the sound was still coming from my phone! It was a pleasant surprise. Overall, I'm really pleased with this purchase, especially considering the price. I'd recommend these to anyone interested in a comfortable pair of headphones for sleeping!\", 'This is a neat little gadget. Soft material and covers the head pretty good.

I'll find a more eco-friendly with better quality model that will last.\\n\\nINITIAL REVIEW: I really like this product. The handband is made of breathable material and I really don't feel the earphones even when sleeping on my side. I was worried it wouldn't fit, because my head circumference is small (54cm) but it fits great. It stays in place until i fall asleep, butwhen I wake up it's not on my head anymore, but it is perfect. Easy to connect to my phone and it can also be used for calls. Great purchase.\", 'Me encanto para dormir y escuchar música relajante muy cómodo no molesta nada', '', \"I work in a hectic environment. Sometimes it can feel overwhelming. These headphones can help to buffer all the background noise so that I can focus on the person in front of me. I can move the actual headphones within the band, so that they're not actually on my ears which is helpful when I'm buffering sound but need to hear.\\n\\nI have on a couple of occasions forgotten to turn them off, and they were still playing after work. So I can attest to a play life of 8-9 hours at least on my set lol.\\n\\nI bought 2pair, and accidentally washed one. It worked for a day or two before it just wouldn't turn on.

Battery life is very good.', 'Hands down, these headphones are truly the best, unbelievable sound quality that you can control on the app with sound setting starts between warm to energetic, very comfortable on the ears and long lasting enjoyment and battery', 'I’m not an audiophile. My AirPods stopped working so I decided I wanted to try on-ear noise canceling headphones with a long battery life. My primary intention is to use them for work calls.\\n\\nI ordered the Bose QC45, very happy with them (I should also mention I was happy with the sound from my basic AirPods before). Except I couldn’t wear them for longer than an hour because my ears would start profusely sweating??? I googled this and turns out it’s a thing! Some people get hot ears from the synthetic material of the ear cups.\\n\\nThe main reason I ordered these was because of the leather ear cups. It worked! No more sweaty ears. My ears are bigger than the round part, maybe that’s why, but I still find them very comfortable. Given the “lack of seal” I find the ANC to be fine for my needs.\\n\\nOne thing I find annoying is that to put them back in their case, you have to slide the sides back in. They slide smoothly and aren’t notched. So basically, every time I take them out of the case I have to readjust them when I put them on, and since they’re not notched as you slide the sides out I find myself readjusting a few times.\\n\\nThe other thing - I was getting frustrated connecting these to my windows work laptop for video calls, but then I remembered there’s an audio jack in the case so now I just use that with no issues. I don’t think they automatically connect to my iPhone like the Bose ones did, but that may be user error. It doesn’t seem like you can easily go between devices like I can with my AirPods from iPhone to MacBook. I didn’t find the app to be intuitive for this either. Hopefully I’ll eventually figure it out.\\n\\nLastly, I did find that these needed to be broken in - I didn’t know that was a thing, the Bose ones didn’t. Right out of the box, music sounded like it did with my AirPods. I played with the settings, etc. For my needs I didn’t really care, I just wanted my ears to stop sweating. Then one day I was listening to music and the sound was much more impressive.\\n\\nI ordered the sand color, but in hindsight I wish I had gotten black. The case is light grey for these and I’m concerned about staining over time if I’m not super careful. Subjective, but I think black would probably also look more sophisticated on video calls. Overall I’m very happy with these!', \"The good: They sound great, very crisp sound without too much bass. They're also pretty comfortable, but if you're moving around, say cleaning your house or something, they will fall off your head. Also, great battery life.\\n\\nThe bad:\\n1. HORRIBLE Bluetooth handling. Once you pair them to two devices, even if you're nowhere near the second device, upon turning them on, expect a few minutes of glitchy audio getting constantly cut, until it becomes okay. The only remedy to this is to factory reset the headphones and not pair them with more than one device. Again, this happens even nowhere near the second device.\\n\\n2. Iffy touch interface. I still can't reliably skip or pause with the touch interface. Volume is a bit more reliable and has a nice gesture to it.\\n\\n3. Pretty mediocre to sub par NC. Really unimpressive compared to Sony or Bose.\\n\\nIn short, I would never buy these knowing what I know now, especially for such a high price.\", 'Recently purchased both the Bang & Olufsen HX headphones and the Bose NC 700 headphones for comparison. My biggest must haves in over the ear headphones are sound quality, call quality and comfort.\\n\\nCall quality\\nThe B&O HX’s call quality is not up to par with Bose. While on a phone call walking outdoors wearing the B&O HX’s, the person on the other end of the call said the background noise was deafening and they could not hear me over the noise (city traffic and wind). I switched to the Bose while on the same call and it was worlds better, lowered background noise, and they could hear me much clearer. Bose won this test!\\n\\nSound Quality\\nThe sound quality of the B&O HX’s was good, however the sound quality depreciates when I switch over to noice canceling. Throughout all modes and different genres of music I noticed the bass is lacking and they focus more on the lyrics and spoken words rather than the music and lyrics. The Bose however blew me out of the water with sound quality, excellent bass, great clarity, and better EQ controls to customize to your liking. Bose wins here as well.\\n\\nComfort\\nThe B&O HX’s are comfortable headphones with amazing build quality. However the earpiece shape is more round than the Bose and did get uncomfortable after about an hour of use. I also found they struggle to stay planted on my head when I’m moving around quickly (not ideal for running or working out). The Bose however have a silicone lining on the upper arm and stay put on my head when running. Bose also won here!\\n\\nOverall the B&O HX’s are good headphones with excellent features and build quality but at $500 and compared to the Bose NC 700 headphones at $300 I could not justify the higher price tag. I need over the ear headphones to be a device I can use at work to take phone calls and video meetings, at the gym, on an outdoor walk, and on a plane. I feel as though the Bose are the better buy but glad I compared both to find the front runner!', \"I did truly love these headphones. I'm a fan of the aesthetics and sound. I've tried many headphones, looking for the ones that play music to my ears. I did return these though due to my ears not fitting completely under the ear pad. No discomfort, even after hours of listening but found it to be troublesome with creating a good seal. Another note, there is circular engraving in the ear cups. There are also earcup commands by swiping on them. The engraving can be quite annoying when trying to skip songs due to your finger naturally wanting to follow the engraving.\\n\\nStill overall great headphones. Can't comment on noise cancelling as it's not really a feature I pay attention to. Isnt the whole point of it to not pay attention? Cant be bad then.\", 'Great sound from these', 'Design and sound are phenomenal. I was lucky to buy it during promotion.', 'While it may not be the industry leader in terms of noise cancellation, these headphones performed well in a noisy airplane where I typically use such headphones.\\n\\nWere they better than Sony WH-1000XM5? Maybe? Maybe not? I understand that \"data doesn\\'t lie\"... but personally, I didn\\'t care much about this - it\\'s not as noticeable to me anyway.\\n\\nWhat IS noticeable though is a vast difference in the quality of materials and the overall build of these headphones versus the Sony WH-1000XM5 (which I also own).\\n\\nI suppose one complaint I have is that the touch controls don\\'t work so well for me. Start/stop are completely fine, but next/previous and volume controls are not as responsive. Could be just practice, but must be mentioned.\\n\\nAll in all, as noise cancelling headphones, they do the job just fine for me. The reason I love these headphones is GREAT sound and the build quality where I can actually tangibly appreciate the premium quality of this piece of equipment.', 'Calidad premium en materiales y audio. Altamente recomendables.', '', 'Me encantaron son extremadamente cómodos las almohadillas son de piel real lo que los hacen muy frescos y no sudas, los micrófonos son muy claros para llamadas y videoconferencia.

In the past it seemed as if skullcandy was trying to protect our ears for us but not anymore, blast them at your own risk.\\n\\nSound Quality - The sound quality is great for all genres but to achieve it, you will need to use the in app 5 band EQ.

You can actually hear the different audio quality, especially in the bass.\", 'Was in need of a new set headphones and after doing my searching I came across these online after seeing such positive feedback I was very interested in them. The bass is next level literally feel like there’s subwoofers behind me when I listen to music. The ANC isn’t the best out there but with the bass an a bit of volume you won’t hear anything anyways ( trust me ). The ability to change every buttons actions is so convenient as well great battery life. Fast charging. Great build soft touch plastic and the ear cups are nice and soft. If anyone is in the market for a good set of headphones with bass ( real bass ) these are the ones. Everyone who I let try them out instantly smiles and laughs away because they can’t believe what they were feeling as the bass shakes/vibrates their head. The Skullcandy iQ is great as well and so easy to use. Haven’t had Skullcandy products in a long time so I was kinda anxious trying them out but I’m so happy I did ! They sound great they look great I couldn’t ask for more and the price is also not bad at all. I don’t leave reviews but I just had to', 'I bought these headphones for the bass, already aware that the noise cancelling would be bad. Its honestly better than i expected but i defenitly wouldn\\'t say its even good. The anc doesnt really work at all. It works better when its off, if that says anything. That said, the bass i defenitly worth the price, and the sound quality is amazing! Defenitly a good purchse, if you can get by the whole \"anc is a waste of money\" thing lmao', \"I'm a mix between a basshead and an audiophile. I installed car stereos for 15 years so I've heard a lot of different types of setups. I had a pair of Sony XB950BT's that I really liked, but they finally broke, so I needed some replacement cans. I loved the Sony's low end and they didn't sound too bad everywhere else either, so I wanted something comparable. I bought a pair of beats solo3's and was very disappointed with the lack of low end, volume, and overall sound quality. So like any intelligent idiot, I did my research after impulse buying something that didn't fit the bill and came across these ANC 2's. They deliver. I wasn't really sure what the sound quality would be like, but it's way better than I expected. These beat the Sony's in every way, better sound quality, more volume by quite a bit, and bass like a couple of 12's in the trunk with 6-700 watts. It's an impressive amount of bass. The only thing missing is feeling it in your chest when the bassline drops. You'd probably have to spend 2k on a setup in your car to replicate the way these sound as a whole package.\\n\\nYou do need to tweak them some with the equalizer in the skull IQ app. I've found that turning the the low and the low mid about 3 lines down from the top and then adjusting the bass through the crusher wheel gets you the cleanest sound. If you turn the crusher bass all the way off, it loses a lot below about 40Hz. But adjusted like that with the wheel at about 10 or 20% gets you a nice full sound with some good thump on the bottom end but it doesn't get muddy. That way also keeps it fairly linear through the volume range so you don't have way too much bass at lower levels until you turn it up like some other ways I had tried tuning it before. Some songs don't sound great above that, but some you can go all the way to the max on the crusher wheel and still sound clean. These seem to have the highest pressure levels around 40Hz and drop off a fair amount under 30Hz. You can still hear them down to and below 20Hz though, but not nearly at the pressure levels you do at 40Hz. The mids and highs are way cleaner than I expected and these handle rock and classic rock very well. Like I said before, these aren't audiophile quality, but from being in the sound industry for a lot of years, I got picky about sound quality, but still love more than average low end. These marry the two perfectly if tuned right and I don't have any problem with using these as my daily set.\\n\\nThey're also very comfortable. They don't clamp too tight on your ears, and the ear cushions go all the way around my ears. No hotspots. I can wear these for hours and be comfortable. The ANC has a hiss when it's on, but I didn't buy these for noise cancelling so I just turn it off. I can't comment on the durability because I just bought them, but if these hold up long term, they're worth every penny and then some if you're like me and want a ton of bass at times, but also want a nice rich/full sounding set of cans when the mood strikes I love that I can change them from one to the other with the roll of the crusher wheel and not have to do anything else.\", 'They’re great, bass u can feel that rumbles ur skull. But tbh I can’t max out the bass slider because of that. It’s almost unbearable bass at max slider uncomfortably. But yeah.. Super long battery life, super soft, good connectivity. I wouldn’t say it’s the clearest sound I’ve ever used in headphones, but that is to be expected in such a bass heavy one and wireless. The noise cancellation is also great.

It is some other Technology which they explain. Easy hookup, great sound, very comfortable Headsets. I highly recommend them.', 'I ordered these since I work on my laptop a lot for sound editing and such.\\n\\nI\\'m mainly a bluetooth girl, and they work great for my phone and laptop! It had a 70% charge straight out the box, so I used it right away.\\n\\nTV-Cable Use: I have a smart TV with Bluetooth capabilities.\\n\\nThe antenna and cable were very easy and fast to set up with the TV! Nice quality sound and i can even control my TV through my headphones (when using an app w/smart TV.)\\n\\nNote: (cable and antenna method) Even if you have USB connection on your TV, plug in the antenna to a separate power source. The TV intercepts w/ static if the audio cable AND antenna are plugged into the same place.\\n\\nTV-Bluetooth function: I\\'d recommend using the provided antenna and audio cable for TV usage. It might be my TV, but the TV-bluetooth sound got a bit shoddy on this method. Still cordless either way!\\n\\nUSB-TV audio function: I don\\'t think my TV has this option, so I wasn\\'t able to test that one.\\n\\nOVERALL: Very pleased with my purchase. In depth instructions, solid packaging. They\\'re extremely comfy, sturdy, and soft! \"All Up In Your Mind\" sounds heavenly in these, so good sound.', 'This pair of headphones sound great, but not for those who love extremely loud blasting music. How loud they can get depends also on the unit. The cushioning around the phones is great making them very comfortable to wear for hours on end and being it\\'s leather, it\\'s not so likely to soak up sweat when worn in hot areas or for a long period of time.\\n\\nAlso, this unit has its own audio voice to indicate that the unit is connected and when you reach max or min volume and tells you when it\\'s on or off when you hit the power button. The up/down volume keys are easy to reach as the are next to the power button on the right ear unit.\\n\\nWARNING: There is a learning curve to setting this up for the first time and the instructions are rather \"touch and go\" and thus, could be better. Though the manual implies the set is specifically for TVs, you can use it on stereo equipment by hooking up the unit with the RCA cable it comes with. YOU NEED NOT HAVE A BLUETOOTH DEVICE TO USE THEM! But you must make the correct settings on your TV or stereo to make them work. Just hope you have time and patience to figure it out when setting them up for the first time or switching units to use them on. This can be a pain if you use it with more than one device and move it back and forth a lot.\\n\\nIt comes with small signal box with is a bit tiny with a dimly lit signal light up indicator. This box needs to be hooked up to the power cord when listening through the headset. Being the signal box is so small, just be careful to put it in a table top place where it won\\'t get bumped or fall behind the shelf or table by accident, or you can easily lose it.\\n\\nMake sure when not in use that the recharging cable is plugged into the headset. Once you power that up, switch the recharging cable back to the signal box so it is getting power.\\n\\nDespite its tininess and lack of ability to hook it up to multiple devices. I still like it and if you don\\'t mind doing a little tinkering, you will too.', 'Great sound and easy hook up.', 'I bought one Rosida Wireless Headphones for TV in April, bought a second one in July for another room & TV.

Here is my updated review.\\n\\nPros: Battery life lasts quite a good while, goes over the ears and adjusts well\\n- Turns off by itself if left alone long enough to preserve battery life.\\n\\nCons: When watching a live video it slightly \"pauses\" the audio like a disturbance (lasts for a split second) Sometimes it\\'s like every 5-15 minutes, other times it\\'s back to back (seconds in between).\\n- It lacks Bass. You can easily fix this with an app on your phone but I mostly use it for my laptop when studying and the audio feels like it\\'s missing life (best way I could put it) It\\'s okay, it\\'s just annoying to adjust it for music though.\\n- Noise cancelation is average, I can still hear people talking when they\\'re next to me, if it had better bass it would\\'ve helped a bit.\\n\\nAll in all, it\\'s an average headset if you\\'re in a budget. At least the replacement works better than the first one.\\n\\nOld Review: [I bought it to use it for studying and cancel out all distractions. The worst headphone set I\\'ve had, the music gets interrupted every 15-30 seconds. It\\'s as if someone paused it then resumed the music for you in a second.\\n\\nIt lacks bass completely, it sounds like someone is talking to you at a normal volume from a distance so you have to crank up the volume.

I mainly use Noise Canceling Headphones to listen to music (or books) while doing yard work (to cancel out noise of lawnmower & edger).

However, due to the confusing instructions, I feel there are a few features I will not be able to use.\\n\\nIncluded in one of the other documents is contact info for the company.\\nA personal preference: I always prefer direct contact info to the manufacturer/seller.\\nI was pleased to see contact info was included with this item.\\n\\nOPERATION\\nPositive aspects\\nAs I stated, basic operation is pretty intuitive. I was easily able to pair these Headphones with my music device.

In addition, it took me very little time to operate the controls by feel alone. These are much easier to operate than my other Bluetooth Headphones.\\n\\nNegative aspects\\nThe features associated with the “+” and “–” buttons are pretty straight forward. However, there are six functions associated with the power button. I will have to experiment with these in order to understand how they work. Mainly they have to do with phone-use controls while wearing these Headphones (one I am totally in the dark about).\\n\\nOf my three Noise Canceling Headphones, these are the only ones that did not come with a protective case.\\n\\nWHY ONLY 3-STARS?\\nI took away one star for each of the following reasons:\\no Confusing instructions\\no Lack of any storage / protective container', 'These headphones are ok sound wise. I was a little disappointed because in the listing it says they have their own app for EQ controls and ANC but it’s just 3 preset settings.

If you’re looking for something simple these will work but if you’re a big audiophile I’d definitely look for higher quality.', 'These headphones are comfortable, well padded and suitable for office use. Sound quality is not premium, a bit too much treble and the bass /midrange could be richer, but is more than acceptable for this price point. The noise cancellation works well and combined with the closed back design, it does an excellent job of taming environmental noise. The included instruction sheet provides easy steps to follow for pairing, the diagram provided for device controls is difficult to interpret, however. (noise cancellation is toggled with the button with the bluetooth logo on it)', \"These headphones arrive well packaged, I found them very easy to connect to my phone.\\nThe next step was to download the Edifier app, which is simple but works well enough.\\n\\nThey're light and very comfortable to wear over an extended period.\\nThe controls are easy to use physical buttons, and I'm so pleased they are as I hate touch sensitive panels on similar headphones.\\nThey also feel quite sturdy and well made.\\n\\nThe appearance is quite plain and innocuous, but I like that as they're less of a target for muggers!\\n\\nThe noise cancelling is pretty good but can't compete with far more expensive models.... this is to be expected though.\\nThe noise cancelling performance for the price is very good though and makes train journeys more peaceful.\\n\\nThe ambient sound setting is very useful when you want to listen to announcements on the train or talk to someone.\\n\\nThe sound quality is okay but not amazing.\\nIt's got the typical v shaped sound profile with emphasised bass and treble.... the mid range suffers because of this.\\nSound stage is also quite narrow, but again that's typical of most closed back headphones.\\n\\nThe app allows 4 different settings for the sound, but i stick to classic as the others make the sound a bit worse to my ears.\\n\\nBattery life has been very good and charges quickly via USB C.\\n\\nI would recommend you get a pouch or carry case if you want to keep them in top condition.\\n\\nFor under £50 these really do offer excellent value for money, they're not the best sounding but they're more than adequate.\\nThey would make a fantastic present for a lucky someone.\\n\\nI hope you find my review helpful.\", 'Sorti de son emballage on trouve le casque, un câble USB-C vers USB-A pour recharger son accu, et un mode d\\'emploi multilingue assez minimaliste.\\n\\nLa finition est assez basique mais correcte, ce casque fermé est pliable au niveau des écouteurs, ce qui limite son encombrement lorsqu\\'il est inutilisé, mais il est dommage qu\\'un sac ne soit pas fourni pour le ranger.\\nDes minuscules repères \"R et L\" sont présents sur le montant intérieur des écouteurs pour indiquer la Droite et la Gauche. Les boutons de commande à l\\'arrière de l\\'écouteur droit sont facilement accessibles grâce à leur relief, sous le même écouteur se trouvent la prise USB-C pour recharger et le bouton d\\'appairage Bluetooth.\\n\\nAvant la première utilisation il faut charger complètement l\\'accu, ce qui lui offrira une autonomie maximale de 68 heures de fonctionnement sans ANC, et 45 heures avec ANC activé. Si on recharge 10 minutes l\\'accu vide, cela lui suffit pour 8 heures d\\'autonomie.\\nEnsuite il faut appairer en Bluetooth de manière classique, ce casque apparaissant dans la liste des périphériques sous le nom de \"EDIFIER WH700NB\". En scannant le QR code sur l\\'emballage on peut installer l\\'application \"Edifier Connect\" qui permet de nombreux réglages.\\n\\nCe casque permet de se connecter à deux périphériques simultanément en Bluetooth, ce qui m\\'est indispensable puisque j\\'utilise souvent simultanément un téléphone et un lecteur HiFi ou MP3. Cependant il fonctionne uniquement en Bluetooth et ne dispose pas d\\'une prise pour l\\'utiliser de manière filaire.\\n\\nÀ l\\'usage :\\n- L\\'appairage BT se fait sans problème et facilement, même pour deux connexions simultanées.\\n- L\\'ANC n\\'est pas très performant et risque de ne pas satisfaire les amateurs d\\'isolation face aux bruits ambiants.\\n- Au niveau qualité sonore, c\\'est peut-être satisfaisant lorsqu\\'on ne recherche pas une approche de la HiFi, mais le son est empâté et ça manque d\\'air, les \"graves\" sont du style bas médium qui s\\'étale et le haut médium et l\\'aigu manquent de définition et d\\'amplitude. globalement c\\'est flatteur si on apprécie la variété enrobée mais cela ne conviendra pas aux amateurs de son HiFi ou aux amateurs de musique de qualité et travaillée.\\nCeci-dit il faut relativiser, on en a pour son argent et ces écouteurs sont écoutables, ne blessent pas l\\'oreille et devraient combler nombre d\\'utilisateurs.\\n- Le port du casque est assez confortable et l\\'arceau se règle facilement pour s\\'adapter à toutes les têtes.\\n\\nEn conclusion ce casque n\\'a vraiment rien à voir avec la HiFi, il n\"est pas assez neutre et défini à mon goût, mais il me semble cependant assez correct dans le genre \"flatteur et coloré\" dans cette gamme de prix, son choix dépendra de vos besoins et de vos goûts finalement …', '', \"These are the third pair of Edifier headphones I've had and I've been delighted with all of them. The previous ones were in ear so this is the first opportunity I've had to test some larger over ear units and it's interesting to compare.\\n\\nPros:\\n- Excellent sound quality considering the price. You can also modify the balance to better suit your own preferences.\\n- Easy to set up and use app giving you additional controls.\\n- Build quality feels solid though still lightweight. These aren't going to match £200+ competitors but are perfectly decent.\\n- Easy to set up and to connect, just took a few seconds and the connection remained strong.\\n\\nCons:\\n- Slightly lighter than I might like personally but this purely my preference.\\n- Don't fold as much as some other options.\\n\\nOverall these are an excellent pair of headphones at a very strong price point that I would happily recommend. I've used for music, podcasts and video calls and they were good on all 3, especially the speech based options. If you are looking for headphones primarily for music there may be better options out there but at this price these are excellent all rounders.\", \"Casque edifier les mousses recouvrent bien les oreilles et sont tres confortables.\\nIl est possible de l'ajuster et de le plier pour le ranger egalement.\\nLivré avec cable de recharge usb C et boite carton.\\nLe son est bon, les basses puissantes et les medium et aigus precis pour ce tarif cest surprenant .\\nSeul reproche lutilisation un peu compliqué de part le fait que les boutons sont multifonctions.\\nSinon la couleur bleu est sympas et il a un bon rapport qualité prix.\\nJe le recommande pour les petits budgets.\\nPs :Il fonctionne avec appli dommage je suis pas fan mais passage obligatoire pour les reglages (voice canceling, reduction de bruit etc)\", '', 'I am always on the lookout for a decent bluetooth headset, time for an upgrade it seems.\\n\\nThe Edifier 700NB headphones are certainly well made, feel good in the hands and comfortable on the head too.

It has (beside the bluetooth button), buttons for volume up/down, power and the charging port as well. The quality of the headphones are on par with what I would call a very premium product.\\n\\nThe Ediifier 700NB even has an android app, although sadly not for windows pcs. speaking of windows, there is a mic too, so you can use it to game/chat with as well. I completely missed it on my first test of the headphones, till i connected it to my pc/laptop.\\n\\nThe app for android can be downloaded from the play store, if your planning on using it with your phone, then you can tailor the headphones for ambient sound/noise cancellation and music type such as rock/pop/jazz effects. it also has a game mode too all on the app.\\n\\nWhen paired with a laptop/pc tablet under windows you can still engage \"game mode\" by double tapping the bluetooth button. There is no windows app that I could find in the ms store. which was a shame. But the headphones performed just fine under windows 11, good quality sound. I performed a speaker test on headset, was quite suprised just how well the drivers responded to the shifting frequency changes.\\n\\nComfortable headphones, partially foldable for stowaway/transport, long run time, easy connect, game mode, adjustable sound settings and a mic too, makes the headset a premium product indeed.

I have a price checker and from what I see the are usually around $30-40, which is still cheap.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, you might be asking why would I buy these. I was looking for iPX7 or iPX8 wireless earbuds so I can listen to music while I shower. The Air Pod Pros are iPX4, which are not good for showering, they cut out every time. The higher the iPX the more water resistant they are.\\n\\nFor this price I was very skeptical because you get what you pay for. Also, I needed something cheap since I already have Air Pod Pros.\\n\\nNow let’s compare:\\nNote: This is only Day 1 and I will update this review if it doesn’t hold up!\\n\\nPrice:\\n-Golrex $30-40 vs AirPod Pros $200.\\n\\nWireless distance:\\n-Golrex claims 33 feet vs Air Pod Pros claim 50 feet.\\n-They both cut out around the same distance. I left my phone in my bedroom, and I went all the way to my back door of my garage, which is on the opposite side of the house until they finally began to cut out.\\n-Very shocking, and with this price I was expecting it to cut right when I left my bedroom.\\n\\nBattery:\\nCan’t compare only day one and I haven’t wore them long.\\n*3 month update\\n-They last longer than my Air Pod Pros, but I always have noise cancellation on with my Air Pod Pros, which drains the battery. Air Pod Pros last about 3-4 hours. While Glorex is about 5 to 6 hours.\\n\\nFeatures:\\n-Golrex for $30-40 you get led screen, volume control, Siri, and a few more, but Air Pod pros clearly win in this category.\\n\\nFeel:\\nThey both feel like a high quality products.\\n\\nCase:\\nGolrex features are actually better than Air Pod Pros when it comes to the case. The size is bulkier though, but if that doesn’t bother you. Golrex is the clear winner in this category!\\n\\nPhone connection:\\nBoth connect easy.\\n\\nSound quality:\\n-This is where I was skeptical, but it’s honestly not bad.\\n-The bass is really good on the Golrex, but the blend between the voices and bass are nowhere near Air Pod Pro level.\\n\\nComfortability:\\nGolrex feels great in my ears and they don’t fall out vs Air Pod Pros feel sketchy at times while working out and I have knocked them out a couple of times.\\n\\nColor:\\nGolrex wins in this category. The air pod pros are just white and nothing special to them.\\n\\nShower:\\nGolrex claims iPX7. I haven’t went swimming with them yet, but I did shower. My music didn’t muffle one time vs Air Pod Pros, which are IPX4, they will go out on you in the shower and you have to let them dry for them to come back. This is annoying, $200 and they are only IPX4!\\n\\nConclusion:\\nI left a review for a reason. l felt as a customer I got more than I expected. Really good overall earbuds being wireless and not corded.\\nAre these Air Pod Pros? no.\\nAre they good earbuds? yes.\\nDo you need to spend for $200 instead of these? That’s up to you. But, if you’re on a budget I would not spend $200. These work honestly just fine for working out, cutting the grass, etc.\\n\\nHope this helps anyone looking to buy. This is not a paid review, just leaving my honest feedback.\\n\\nP.S. I will be using these more than the shower, and alternating with my Air Pod Pros.\\n\\n3 Month Update:\\nThey still work. I also found new tips for the earbuds. They are called SpinFit CP100 Plus for IEM. These tips will make the sound of your earbuds even better! I advise you to change the tips of this earbuds to SpinFit CP100 Plus. These specific tips will help improve sound, isolation, and comfort. I got the medium for my ears, but they have: Small, Medium, and Large.\\n\\n*4 Month Update:\\n\\nThe left earbud has stopped working completely, but after contacting Golrex, they shipped a new set to me for free through their lifetime warranty. Make sure to register your product if you decide to get these earbuds to activate the Lifetime Warranty.', 'Bought these to replace my old pair that had broken. These headphones are comfortable and easy to wear. I use them when doing intense exercise as well as just doing things around the house. They stay in place and have a good battery life and are easy to recharge. They have a good volume level and seem easy to pair with my cell phone. Happy with this product.', \"Amazing over-ear headphones! These are so comfortable & very well made. Since I started working out again, I needed some over-ear headphones & these are great. They don't fall or slip as the tips (it does come with 3 different sizes to choose from), sits comfortably in your ears & wraps almost completely around your ears.\\n\\nThe sound is powerful, especially if you listen to music with a lot of bass like I do. The treble is outstanding as well, words are crisp even through the bass.\\n\\nSometimes, I usually have just one side in & the other hanging off my ear & it stays put. I'm clumsy so here & there I will hit it off my ear & this thing has bounced off of everything in my home & is unbelievably durable.\\n\\nThe battery life is soooooo good! I've literally gone a week without charging it & that's with using it for at least 3-4 hours every morning! That might not seem very long but I've had others that would only last a couple days before having to charge them again. These come with a charger but since everything we have are C-cord connectef, I just use what is available. It only takes a couple hours, if even, to be at full charge.\\n\\nI will definitely be getting another one of these once these go kaput... that's how good they are! I highly recommend you get one, too... you won't regret it!!\", \"This product is seriously an amazing value. It does almost everything better than the majority of similar name brand products. Where it falters is sound quality. It is pretty good but it's definitely not amazing. Highs, lows and mids are all pretty okay but all are a little muddy. The mids are the muddiest which is what makes it sound like you're listening just a little under water. Audio quality is still good and again, better than some name brand products. Overall, amazing for well under fourty bucks.\\n\\nThe rest is pretty nice. Carry/charge case is a little big but that's what you get for over the ear buds. The readout on the inside is really nice but not totally needed. Fit heirs on the med-large ear size, is comfortable and overall feel, fit and finish of everything is middle-high quality. Seems rugged and I hugely appreciate the physical buttons for control rather than touch buttons like the vast majority of name brand competitors. Battery life is alright on the buds at around 4-5hrs because the case will charge them about 4x or more. Not sure how they'll hold up over time but they're so cheap they're borderline disposable ~1yr.\", \"I love that they wrap around my ears, so that they don't fall off when I run. They look and sound great, no complaints. They were very easy to set up. Noise canceling? Hard to say honestly... I think it's what you expect. Charging is easy/fast.\", \"I wouldn't call these noise cancelling BUT i will say they hit the mark on every other feature. Range on these is amazing. I can go into another room. downstairs, outside and still have good sound and even talk on the phone. I use these in the shower when I WASH MY HAIR. these are my shower head phones. not only do they not fall off, but i can wear them to wash my hair. Come on.\", 'Good sound, pairs easily, holds a charge. I’ve bought 2 pair— had a problem with the second, but the seller replaced it promptly. Great customer service.', \"Absolutely love these.

When I power these headphones up, I simply know that they're going to connect. Not so with my previous headphones that cost nearly as much.

The ZIHNIC's start to lose the connection even at 5m sometimes and you'd be lucky to get 15m in a straight line before losing the connection completely. With the Taotronics I could be 100m line of sight and still have a great connection. Or be 20m away and behind two steel shed walls and still get a connection.\\n\\nThey're tough and the noise cancelling is great but not quite as good as the Taotronics.

I can hear audio without having to strain and the noise cancellation reduces the background noise sufficiently. The battery life is quite robust and they charge up quickly. The carrying case is nice and I don't worry about them breaking in my backpack. I only use these a couple hours a month and so they were well worth the money for me.\", 'Sound quality is good with a lot of bass. Integrated microphone is not the best but decent enough to make calls\\n\\nThe noise cancelling works great and is reducing background noise greatly however it makes some white noise, which is not really important when you are in a noisy environement thus the button to activate and deactivate the noise canceling is a nice addition.\\n\\nThis comes with a jack connector and cable, I am able to plug it in the entertainment system during flight.\\nI had seats near the jet engine, kids .. and the noise canceling is perfect for those situations plus the audio is much better than any headsets handed out during flights', \"Bought these to replace my failing earbuds...They work great. Sound quality is excellent and the noise cancellation works very well. These are a great value for the money if you are looking for good, comfortable headphones but don't want to spend a bunch! If I had a complaint, it would be the bluetooth does take a bit to connect...my earbuds would connect almost instantly - these take 10 or 15 seconds to connect. Its not that big of a deal, but its the only criticism I have!\", \"The headphones came nicely packaged which is a plus. They also came charged which is super awesome. They are comfortable so far, I'm no expert but the sound quality is amazing. My one drawback so far is that I have to disconnect from my phone in order to connect to my laptop.

The charge seems to last forever and the case is great. I have them paired to my phone and my computer. I have found that sometimes I have to temporarily turn off the blue tooth on my phone in order to have them pick up my computer, but it's as easy as pushing a button and they switch to the computer, hit the button to turn blue tooth back on and they immediately go back to my phone.

I’d definitely recommend this product to those looking for quality headphones.\", \"I been wanting some over the ear headphones and decided to go with these because I'm a bass lover. These feel and are premium quality. Connecting to Bluetooth is super easy and the app also has a few settings that you can adjust for your preference. After hooking up I put on a song that I know has bass and I let it rip. When I say these sound good even in high bass, it's an understatement. These are the most fun headphones you can get and for the price you can't compete. From now on I will make sure I get a set every other year.\", 'This is my pick of the year! Maybe the century!\\n\\nI am both Autistic, and also a little biased.\\n\\nI had the previous generation skull crushers. The left side broke, and skull candy replaced them in warranty for free.\\n\\nI wore those replacement headphones for about four more years until the bass slider started acting up.\\n\\nSo when it came time to by a new pair, it was between these and the ANC model. The ANC model was about 100 dollars more, and I’m not a big fan of ANC’s because they usually have a high pitched hiss whenever there’s no noise coming through.\\n\\nI was super happy when I found the non-ANC model. Because they were cheaper and most closely resembled my old pair.\\n\\nThe bass is just a touch stronger than the last generation. Highs and mids are nice too.\\n\\nI really like the bass slider, because anything with a muddy baseline, you can turn down. Also anytime you are listening to an audible book, if the voice is low, you can turn the bass down.\\n\\nAll in all I would buy these again.\\n\\nI have recommended to several friends, some Autistic, some not. Everyone that tries them wants a pair and are really excited they are so affordable.', 'I like these . They really seal to your ears & the sound is nice. However the volume is not all that much. In my opinion the volume could be louder. Thes are however easy to link to Bluetooth & stay linked. Easy to use. Thank you Amazon.', 'These are extremely comfortable, easy to pack, and the buttons are easy to press and use to connect to different devices. The battery life is INCREDIBLY long and the sound is absolutely incredible from one song to the next. The Quality of the Noise Cancellation is really next level, but not advisable for people, mainly kids or people who are not stationary or in a safe place to use in public. The only reason being that it can block out many or ALL voices that could be trying to get their attention or warn them of obstacles. Thats why I only use these at home, in a vehicle I’m not driving, or when I am doing a solo housekeeping job so I am aware of all the tools I am using.', \"I wear them mostly to the gym but also at home the sound is amazing the battery life is actually crazy and there so comfortable only thing I noticed is they do slide off a bit when I do certain exercises but that's as expected overall best headphones I've every purchased\", \"Overall I am very pleased with these headphones. I'm not super knowledgeable or picky on sound details so I cannot give a super techy sounding review. That being said if you're a normal person that is just looking for a solid pair of headphones that aren't overpriced these are great. I mainly got these for the gym which they are great for because of the bass. They are not the noise cancelling version so don't get them and write a bad review because of that because you'll look ridiculous. haha. Again very pleased which has been my general experience with skull candy and the extra charging cable thrown in is a nice touch. Well done skull candy.\", \"I've owned the first wireless Crushers and now the Crusher Evo. Like a lot of reviews describe it, they're absolutely fun to use. If you're one of those people who has never owned a Skullcandy product - the 'Crusher bass' is not simply a equalizer bass boost that other headphone companies offer. There's a physical slider on the left headphone earcup right below the orange button. Sliding this upwards increases the vibrations generated by physical components within the headphone itself. You absolutely have to try it on maximum strength on some bass heavy music --- it will literally make your head rattle.\\n\\nMy personal favourite is watching movies on my ipad with the Crushers. Try out some bass heavy movies like Michael Bay film, flight scenes from Top Gun Maverick, or the ending sequence of Avengers Endgame and you'll understand what I mean. And don't even get me started on playing games with the Crusher Evos --- absolutely mind blowing :)\\n\\nFor the price you pay for Crusher Evos, they're definitely worth the value compared to other brands at the same price.

They are perfect for using on long flights thanks to their long battery life and comfortable over the ear cushions. The craftsmanship quality is great, and it’s so nice to be able to adjust the bass with the slide of your finger depending on what you’re doing. They also come with a nice travel carrying bag, and the quick charge feature is so nice to have when you're on the run. Setup to my iPhone took less than 15 seconds with just one push of a button. I’d definitely recommend this product to those looking for quality headphones.\", \"I been wanting some over the ear headphones and decided to go with these because I'm a bass lover. These feel and are premium quality. Connecting to Bluetooth is super easy and the app also has a few settings that you can adjust for your preference. After hooking up I put on a song that I know has bass and I let it rip. When I say these sound good even in high bass, it's an understatement. These are the most fun headphones you can get and for the price you can't compete. From now on I will make sure I get a set every other year.\", 'This is my pick of the year! Maybe the century!\\n\\nI am both Autistic, and also a little biased.\\n\\nI had the previous generation skull crushers. The left side broke, and skull candy replaced them in warranty for free.\\n\\nI wore those replacement headphones for about four more years until the bass slider started acting up.\\n\\nSo when it came time to by a new pair, it was between these and the ANC model. The ANC model was about 100 dollars more, and I’m not a big fan of ANC’s because they usually have a high pitched hiss whenever there’s no noise coming through.\\n\\nI was super happy when I found the non-ANC model. Because they were cheaper and most closely resembled my old pair.\\n\\nThe bass is just a touch stronger than the last generation. Highs and mids are nice too.\\n\\nI really like the bass slider, because anything with a muddy baseline, you can turn down. Also anytime you are listening to an audible book, if the voice is low, you can turn the bass down.\\n\\nAll in all I would buy these again.\\n\\nI have recommended to several friends, some Autistic, some not. Everyone that tries them wants a pair and are really excited they are so affordable.', 'I like these . They really seal to your ears & the sound is nice. However the volume is not all that much. In my opinion the volume could be louder. Thes are however easy to link to Bluetooth & stay linked. Easy to use. Thank you Amazon.', 'These are extremely comfortable, easy to pack, and the buttons are easy to press and use to connect to different devices. The battery life is INCREDIBLY long and the sound is absolutely incredible from one song to the next. The Quality of the Noise Cancellation is really next level, but not advisable for people, mainly kids or people who are not stationary or in a safe place to use in public. The only reason being that it can block out many or ALL voices that could be trying to get their attention or warn them of obstacles. Thats why I only use these at home, in a vehicle I’m not driving, or when I am doing a solo housekeeping job so I am aware of all the tools I am using.', \"I wear them mostly to the gym but also at home the sound is amazing the battery life is actually crazy and there so comfortable only thing I noticed is they do slide off a bit when I do certain exercises but that's as expected overall best headphones I've every purchased\", \"Overall I am very pleased with these headphones. I'm not super knowledgeable or picky on sound details so I cannot give a super techy sounding review. That being said if you're a normal person that is just looking for a solid pair of headphones that aren't overpriced these are great. I mainly got these for the gym which they are great for because of the bass. They are not the noise cancelling version so don't get them and write a bad review because of that because you'll look ridiculous. haha. Again very pleased which has been my general experience with skull candy and the extra charging cable thrown in is a nice touch. Well done skull candy.\", \"I've owned the first wireless Crushers and now the Crusher Evo. Like a lot of reviews describe it, they're absolutely fun to use. If you're one of those people who has never owned a Skullcandy product - the 'Crusher bass' is not simply a equalizer bass boost that other headphone companies offer. There's a physical slider on the left headphone earcup right below the orange button. Sliding this upwards increases the vibrations generated by physical components within the headphone itself. You absolutely have to try it on maximum strength on some bass heavy music --- it will literally make your head rattle.\\n\\nMy personal favourite is watching movies on my ipad with the Crushers. Try out some bass heavy movies like Michael Bay film, flight scenes from Top Gun Maverick, or the ending sequence of Avengers Endgame and you'll understand what I mean. And don't even get me started on playing games with the Crusher Evos --- absolutely mind blowing :)\\n\\nFor the price you pay for Crusher Evos, they're definitely worth the value compared to other brands at the same price. I also use Tile for my keys/wallet at home, so having that feature built into the headphones is nice.

All the previous versions focused way too much on the bass drivers and ignored sound quality and volume output, but the ANC 2's have checked every box this time around.\\n\\nSound Output - They are so loud! In the past it seemed as if skullcandy was trying to protect our ears for us but not anymore, blast them at your own risk.\\n\\nSound Quality - The sound quality is great for all genres but to achieve it, you will need to use the in app 5 band EQ. I personally max out the highs and mid-highs, 2 notches of mids above 50% and the rest leveled.\\n\\nCrusher Bass - No headphones can compete with the bass.\\n\\nSkull IQ app - Most headphone app seems rushed and not well put together. Skull IQ is polished, easy to use and surprisingly well put together. It also brings more features to the headsets than you thought was necessary.\\n\\nComfort and Esthetics - These headsets are a full soft-plastic build, so it is very light but still feels robust. Ear cushions are soft and completely covers your ears (could be sweat resistant). Overall look is sleek and classy.\\n\\nI highly recommend these headphones to anyone besides audiophiles.

You can actually hear the different audio quality, especially in the bass.\", 'Was in need of a new set headphones and after doing my searching I came across these online after seeing such positive feedback I was very interested in them. The bass is next level literally feel like there’s subwoofers behind me when I listen to music. The ANC isn’t the best out there but with the bass an a bit of volume you won’t hear anything anyways ( trust me ). The ability to change every buttons actions is so convenient as well great battery life. Fast charging. Great build soft touch plastic and the ear cups are nice and soft. If anyone is in the market for a good set of headphones with bass ( real bass ) these are the ones. Everyone who I let try them out instantly smiles and laughs away because they can’t believe what they were feeling as the bass shakes/vibrates their head. The Skullcandy iQ is great as well and so easy to use. Haven’t had Skullcandy products in a long time so I was kinda anxious trying them out but I’m so happy I did ! They sound great they look great I couldn’t ask for more and the price is also not bad at all. I don’t leave reviews but I just had to', 'I bought these headphones for the bass, already aware that the noise cancelling would be bad. Its honestly better than i expected but i defenitly wouldn\\'t say its even good. The anc doesnt really work at all. It works better when its off, if that says anything. That said, the bass i defenitly worth the price, and the sound quality is amazing! Defenitly a good purchse, if you can get by the whole \"anc is a waste of money\" thing lmao', \"I'm a mix between a basshead and an audiophile. I installed car stereos for 15 years so I've heard a lot of different types of setups. I had a pair of Sony XB950BT's that I really liked, but they finally broke, so I needed some replacement cans. I loved the Sony's low end and they didn't sound too bad everywhere else either, so I wanted something comparable. I bought a pair of beats solo3's and was very disappointed with the lack of low end, volume, and overall sound quality. So like any intelligent idiot, I did my research after impulse buying something that didn't fit the bill and came across these ANC 2's. They deliver. I wasn't really sure what the sound quality would be like, but it's way better than I expected. These beat the Sony's in every way, better sound quality, more volume by quite a bit, and bass like a couple of 12's in the trunk with 6-700 watts. It's an impressive amount of bass. The only thing missing is feeling it in your chest when the bassline drops. You'd probably have to spend 2k on a setup in your car to replicate the way these sound as a whole package.\\n\\nYou do need to tweak them some with the equalizer in the skull IQ app. I've found that turning the the low and the low mid about 3 lines down from the top and then adjusting the bass through the crusher wheel gets you the cleanest sound. If you turn the crusher bass all the way off, it loses a lot below about 40Hz. But adjusted like that with the wheel at about 10 or 20% gets you a nice full sound with some good thump on the bottom end but it doesn't get muddy. That way also keeps it fairly linear through the volume range so you don't have way too much bass at lower levels until you turn it up like some other ways I had tried tuning it before. Some songs don't sound great above that, but some you can go all the way to the max on the crusher wheel and still sound clean. These seem to have the highest pressure levels around 40Hz and drop off a fair amount under 30Hz. You can still hear them down to and below 20Hz though, but not nearly at the pressure levels you do at 40Hz. The mids and highs are way cleaner than I expected and these handle rock and classic rock very well. Like I said before, these aren't audiophile quality, but from being in the sound industry for a lot of years, I got picky about sound quality, but still love more than average low end. These marry the two perfectly if tuned right and I don't have any problem with using these as my daily set.\\n\\nThey're also very comfortable. They don't clamp too tight on your ears, and the ear cushions go all the way around my ears. No hotspots. I can wear these for hours and be comfortable. The ANC has a hiss when it's on, but I didn't buy these for noise cancelling so I just turn it off. I can't comment on the durability because I just bought them, but if these hold up long term, they're worth every penny and then some if you're like me and want a ton of bass at times, but also want a nice rich/full sounding set of cans when the mood strikes I love that I can change them from one to the other with the roll of the crusher wheel and not have to do anything else.\", 'They’re great, bass u can feel that rumbles ur skull. But tbh I can’t max out the bass slider because of that. It’s almost unbearable bass at max slider uncomfortably. But yeah.. Super long battery life, super soft, good connectivity. I wouldn’t say it’s the clearest sound I’ve ever used in headphones, but that is to be expected in such a bass heavy one and wireless. The noise cancellation is also great. It doesn’t completely silence the surroundings but it dampens it heavily enough that it’s cool to me. There’s a switch that allows the noise “damper” to turn on or off, to hear ur surroundings better. Pretty neat. Overall, im happy i bought it for sure.', 'If you love bass, these are for you. They’re comfortable to wear and you can really feel the impact of the bass through your skull. If you were around in the 80s/90s and remember window rattling bass, it’s available with these. The ability to adjust the bass on the fly is nice too! They sound great!', 'La calidad del bajeo es bueno, dependiendo el tipo de música que escuches claro.

I am happy to say that I really like these a lot.\\n\\nOn the plus side, these come well-packaged with good, easy-to-follow instructions. It’s very easy to pair with my Kindle and my tablet and cell phones. They are also easy to store in a protective zippered case and they charge up quickly with different charging cables. They hold a charge for a long time.\\n\\nWhat makes these extra-nice is the sound quality - it is rich and immersive. I often have an issue with the quality of the bass but not with these; there is a simple sliding bass adjuster with which you can control the bass but even pulled all the way down they sounded great. I have attached some photos which show you the sliding adjuster and know it’s easy to reach all the controls with your hands while the headphones are on.\\n\\nThe only critique I have is that I found the headphones to be a little uncomfortable if worn for any length of time. My husband did not have this issue with these and he has declared that these headphones are for him.\\n\\nRecommended with the one issue above.', \"I haven't gotten to use these much but the little time I have I am in love with them. Most buy them for the ability to increase the bass but for me it was the opposite! I had a pair years ago that you could adjust the bass on and they helped tremendously with the headaches I get from the bass, so far since I can turn the bass all the way down on the earphone it is helping too. They connected easily to my laptop the first time and every time I have used them. As I said I have the bass turned all the way down so I cannot comment on that but otherwise the sound quality is great!\", \"The Crushers are a meme. They have been for years and I did try the originals and they were pretty terrible. I saw these pop up and decided to give them a shot.\\n\\nThe Bluetooth connection seems great and I've had zero dropouts but there is also a pretty hefty amount of latency, definitely more than enough to ruin lip sync. The wired connection is much better, but I am also plugging it into a ~$20k audio chain so it's kind of being carried by that but even being wired at all totally eliminates the latency so it's a win in my books.\\n\\nIsolation is actually quite poor for a closed back. It really doesn't block out much outside noise at all, but it's not that bad when actually listening to things and conversely, it leaks a LOT of noise to the people around you like a semi-open set.\\n\\nComfort is honestly great, but I do wish that there was more space inside the cups, my ears basically touch the pads all the way around.\\n\\nThe sound quality overall is about average, and tuning is fairly neutral with what seems to be a bit of rolled off treble so detail does suffer quite a bit, but using the AutoEQ (everyone has free access to EQ whether it be on PC or mobile and if you own these and aren't using it, you wasted your money) preset for the Crusher Evo does make them DRASTICALLY more capable. The haptic bass is hilarious. It's fun, but it is also basically pointless above around 10% of the slider, any more than that and it just exclusively takes away from all performance and sound quality. Is it funny to crank it to max and listen to bassy tracks or action movies? Yes. Does it sound good or add anything positive? Absolutely not. That being said, the tactile feel of having it around 5-10% is actually pretty cool and I do like it.\\n\\nIn stock form without EQ and with the Bluetooth latency taken into consideration, these are a firm 3 star. With EQ and hard wired, I'd put them closer to 4 stars. Price wise, these are a $100 headphone and the listing I got them from had them at a $199.99 price and is now at $179.99 and at that price, these are a total joke and in no way worth that asking price. They aren't worth a single cent over $100 and in my opinion should be closer to $75 solely because of the fairly unique haptic bass. If Skullcandy could tone down the haptic bass to a more usable range and cap out around 15% of the total but retain the whole sweep for finer adjustment and get the stock tuning in line with something closer to Harman (again, EQ is free and can accomplish this), these would be a great buy at $100 for someone wanting something fun and engaging. The Bluetooth latency is probably a thing of the past seeing as that these are a few years old and Bluetooth codecs nowadays are much better so the newer models most likely don't suffer from this nearly as much, but I can't say for sure. Overall decent product just a bit overpriced and needs some help to perform where they should.\", \"The sound quality is great with everything coming through clearly, the bass was fantastic. One thing that effects the sound quality is the positioning of the headphones because they do not fully envelope the ears and may press on and block some of the ears. This also effects the noise canceling a little. Because they are on ear a little they can get a little uncomfortable over time but expect this will vary depending on the person and the size of their head and ears. As with any headphones the controls take a little getting used to and these are the same. Don't have a good idea about the battery life yet, will update when I do. Really like the looks and build of these.\", 'In my experience Skullcandy always delivers. This headset is easy to use, easy to take with you and the case keeps is safe when you’re not using it. It has good battery life and charges fast. I love that you can easily control the bass level. These aren’t as awesome at noise cancelation as my AirPod Max headphones, and they don’t have quite the same sound quality, but I don’t like to travel with those, because they are so expensive. These Skullcandy headphones are affordable, have great sound and travel well. They are also great for keeping in your bag, so you always have a pair of headphones with you.', 'Still not better than AirPods, but given its price and branding for skull candy, it’s a pretty mid range basic headset that could last you a while.

Great for tough gym sessions, noise cancelation is amazing, and it paired easily with my iPhone. Very comfortable and fits perfectly around the ear. Also, very long battery life compared to other ear buds I have purchased.\", \"I am someone who likes products that are good enough and don't understand how others are willing to pay $200 for a pair of headphones. I am also someone who doesn't want a junk product, just good enough quality at a good enough price. I bought these wireless earphones because I accidentally lost mine. Considering these earphones don't have the trusted brand of a name like Sony or Apple, it's always a bit of a gamble to buy a product that doesn't carry the peace of mind of a well-known big brand name, but it also doesn't carry the high price tag of one of those brands. I am writing this review because I am pleasantly surprised with the overall quality of these earphones. Both the sound quality and the build quality meet or exceed my expectations. The price makes it a great value find. The shape is comfortable for a 1-hour walk, no issues. Battery life seems normal to above normal. I've only had them for a few days but already find them to be better than my previous headphones that I lost. If they were to break or stop working prematurely, I will update this review. But if you're reading this now, that means they are still good.\", 'I have owned more than a dozen types of earbuds including two pairs of Apples. Being a woman, I have smaller ears and I’ve always had difficulty keeping them in my ears when on exercise equipment. These earbuds are so comfortable and stay put, give me amazing quality of sound, awesome noise canceling and the charge seems to last forever. They seem to connect instantly with my device unlike others that I’ve always had to pair up with every use. I’m thrilled, they will be the only ones I ever buy again! Best of all the price can’t be beat.', \"Sound quality is surprisingly good for the price. Plenty enough bass, but not too much where it takes over. Mids and highs have a good balance. The volume is plenty loud enough to use in noisy environments.\\nBut my favorite features are definitely the ear hooks and having physical buttons for the controls.\\nThese things stay put far better than the normal style earbuds when doing any kind of physical activity or even eating. And on the infrequent occasion when you do have to readjust these on your ears, you're not constantly accidentally pushing the oversensitive touch controls that most regular earbuds have these days. Starting to get tired of that.\\nBattery life is definitely awesome. Lasts a super long time. Far longer than any of my other sets of regular earbuds. I've had these for going on a month now and I'm just charging the case for the first time. Pretty amazing.\\nSo yeah, these are definitely worth the price. Hopefully they'll last a while.\", \"One thing I personally don't like about these nowadays is that there's no ear hook. These are so comfortable and you never have to worry about them falling off! I recommend these for great sound quality, comfortability, and compatibility for androids. Excellent product! The battery lasts absolutely forever so don't worry about that either!\", 'I purchased these earbuds because I lost the charging case for a much more expensive set of earbuds and resolved not to throw good money after bad in search of audiophile quality.\\n\\nPros: the fit of these earbuds is astoundingly good and the over-the-ear hooks are comfortable and better than my high priced buds. These two features alone make this a good purchase. I can comfortably work while wearing them without fear that they will dislodge, and the noise isolation is very good. The sound quality for podcasts is very good. Despite some other negative reviews about the controls, I actually like the physical controls on these buds and find them convenient to use, because I can feel the buttons on the earbuds. I don\\'t know how the battery will hold up, but in the short time that I have owned them the batteries in both the buds and the base have held a good charge.\\n\\nCons: Read the advertisement carefully: these earbuds do not have active noise-cancelling playback. I blame myself for not reading the advertisement better, and I do like the noise isolation that these earbuds provide, but I could not rate them highly as a \"noise cancelling\" device, at least for playback. The sound quality for music playback is acceptable, given the price point, but the bass gets a muddy fast and there\\'s detectable distortion at higher (but otherwise safe) volume.\\n\\nBottom line: a solid 4 stars and solid value for my purposes.', \"LOVE THESE BUDS.. my husband is ill so I have buds in from the time I get up till the time i go to bed.. the battery last all day and then I charge them before bed... the FIT IS AWSOME.. they are not stiff.. very flexible..the sound is great.. compared to the last pair I had I actually had to turn volume down because these buds didn't need to be up that far for good sound...\\nthe price was surprising for how these buds perform!! awesome!!\", 'I bought these earbuds to use while traveling and found them to be a very good value and easy to use. Well, not supposed to be sound blocking, I did find them very helpful in blocking noise while flying. I like the feature on the case that shows you the battery life. I recommend them highly.', \"Très bien ! Le son est pas incroyable mais bon , on peut pas s'attendre à mieux à ce prix.\\nTrès bon maintient .\\nPetit bémol pour la boîte qui est super glissante Oo\", '', 'Lo mejores auriculares Bluetooth aparte de el sonido genial y muy fuerte batería dura mucho , son cómodas y no hay problemas de emparejar como en otras ni si vais a sacar una por una', '', 'Ich habe die BX29 als Ersatz für meine verschwundenen JBL Wave 100 Buds gekauft. Ich nutze die Kopfhörer hauptsächlich für Hörbücher und zum Telefonieren und für diesen Zweck sind Sie auf jeden Fall top geeignet. Im Vergleich zu den JBL ist die Sprache natürlicher und für mich dadurch besser zu verstehen. Bei Music ist der Bass wenn man die passende Größe Stöpsel verwendet sehr gut, ich verwende jedoch eine Nummer kleiner um besser die Umwelt um mich herum beim Laufen hören zu können, mit den kleineren Stöpseln finde ich die Earbuds auch angenehmer zu tragen. Die JBL (Model ohne Bügel) mußte ich immer ganz fest ins Ohr drücken damit sie hielten, die BX29 sitzen dank dem Bügel auch ohne Druck sehr angenehm und fallen auch nicht heraus. Wobei die Bügel auch nicht wie bei anderen Bluetooth Headsets die ich schon hatte mit der Brille um den korrekten Sitz konkurieren. Ich hatte zwischendurch \"günstige\" in-ears beim Discounter gekauft, diese waren jedoch für mich praktisch nicht zu gebrauchen.\\nPositiv ist mir außerdem das automatische pairing bei der Entnahme aus der Ladeschale aufgefallen, welches zu den am besten funktionierenden gehört die ich bisher benutzt habe, meine großen Over-Ear ANC Kopfhören könnten sich da eine Scheibe von abschneiden.\\nAppropos Noise Canceling: die BX29 haben nur ENC, kein ANC, wer wirklich auf das Noise Canceling angewiesen ist sollte lieber in große Over-Ear Kopfhörer mit guten ANC investieren.\\nIch hatte die BX29 extra als ein günstigeres In-Ear Model ausgesucht für dne Fall das diese auch verlohren gehen, würde diese aber auch ansonsten als in-ears jetzt wieder kaufen. Die JBL hatten das doppelte gekostet, eine schlechtere Sprachverständlichkeit und wesentlich schlechtere Reichweite in der Wohnung.\\nJe nach Anwendung habe ich auch noch mehrere andere Kopfhörer im Einsatz, aber als kleine, günstige, portable in-ears sind die BX29 wirklich zu empfehlen.', '', \"I have had wireless ear buds before, and normally I lose them (they fall out) before they break. These have a useful over-the-ear hook that is very comfortable and ensures they don't fall out. I have health issues that means I can fall over when my legs give way. I use crutches, but when I fall, my main concern is trying not to get hurt, so concern for my ear buds is far from my mind. So far, I have fallen over a number of times while using these ear buds and not once have they fallen off my ears. I would imagine they would be great for runners or for use during gym workouts for the same reason - they don't fall out.\\n\\nThe battery life has not caused me any concerns. I tend to use them for between 2 to 6 hours at most though. Each time I stop using them they go back in their charging case. I charge the case every few days - not because it is out of power, but just to keep it topped up.\\n\\nSound quality for me is perfectly fine. I tend to listen to BBC Sounds or to Audible audiobooks. I am not an audiophile - these are more than good enough for me.\\n\\nUsing for making phone calls - I have had no real complaints from people on the other end of a call. I have often used them to make calls from a car or when outside, even in windy weather. Although once when I was out in extremely windy and wet weather the other person did say they had trouble hearing me - which is understandable.\\n\\nThe control buttons, as with all such ear buds, do take a little getting used to as not all devices use the same sequence of short or long taps to do the same things. However, they do work pretty well. The basics or volume up / down and pause/play work great - I tend to do other things on the phone rather than try to remember the exact button press method for more complicated functions.\\n\\nThe best feature to me at least - and remember, I'm not an audiophile - is that you can wear both buds, but turn one off. This means you can double the length of time you can use the earbuds between recharging - as long as you only use one at a time. It also allows you to have one ear free to listen to your surroundings / other people. For listening to audiobooks or music while out and about this works well for me. When one goes flat (only happened once on a long day out), you simply turn the other bud on, and carry on. It means I don't need to carry the charging case with me on a day trip.\\n\\nI've only had them for a few weeks, so I can't comment on how long they will last - only time will tell. As long as they last more than 12 months, I'll likely replace them when they fail with the same ones, or possibly their successor.\\n\\nIn summary, they meet all my requirements and I'm very happy with them.\", 'I finally bought these earbuds after years of considering and I am so glad I did! I was previously put off by the short battery life of such products and also because I wanted to use them with an iPhone and have found that Apple earphones are too large to fit my relatively small ears. (I have ended up buying childrens’ earphones and then putting the smallest foam tip on the ends and they still feel a bit too big). So when I saw that these came with several different sizes of ear pieces, were small in the first place and also had a good long battery life I decided to try some, and I’m so pleased I did! They fit nicely into my ears and the curly part makes sure they stay in place so you don’t have to force them into your ears to make them stay! I use them in the car and find I can hear the person I am speaking to far more clearly than when I was running my phone through the car’s audio system, and they have a similar experience. I assume this is because of the noise cancelling function. The battery has not run out on me yet and the little charging case is really neat. Altogether I really am thrilled with these and would highly recommend them.

At 20% the bluetooth starts cutting in and out on the microphone connection, which makes them unusable for meetings. You *can* switch to a wired connection, but (A) as far as I can tell the audio jack has no microphone connection, and (2) if you attempt to charge while using the audio jack to at least listen to things, there is a feedback buzz that occurs. I suppose I can at least switch to wired to listen to stuff while I'm working, but that means it's not charging, and I can't have meetings until it is charged... so... while these work great when they have power, I'm going to have to give this a low rating for actual usability for work purposes.\\n\\nUpdate: After 2 years of use, these are now refusing to stay connected to my PC, and I have no idea why. They stay connected to other stuff just fine, and other things seem to have no issue staying connected to my PC, but this headset just doesn't want to stay connected for some reason.

That will probably sound weird, but they just feel a little lacklustre, somehow. In any case, husband has adopted those and loves them.\\n\\nWe needed a third pair for when batteries run low (we are both in headphones throughout the day every day) so we plumped for these - something for us to rotate to if and when we needed to recharge our respective old reliables.\\n\\nAnd they're marvellous! They're comfortable (although, just quickly, I have a smaller head than husband and I think I find them ever so slightly more comfy than he) and the sound quality is fab.

He loves them too much!! :)', \"My 3.5-year-old son loves these headphones and they're great for long car or airplane rides (kids' shows can be maddening in a confined space). They work well, have amazing battery life, and the sound quality is good. I appreciate the decibel limit on it. It's nice not having to worry about my son accidentally damaging his hearing by cranking the volume up too high. The flashing colorful lights look great and make it fun for my son to wear the headphones. My only complaint is that the controls are a little hard to use because it's very difficult to see the symbols on the buttons. They are small and they're the same color as the body of the headphones around them. Making them a different/contrasting color or even making them back-lit would be a huge improvement and make them much easier to use. It's frustrating trying to figure out which button is which in the backseat of a dark car at night. Overall, however, they're a great product for the price.\", \"My grandson loves these and I do, too!

I started to notice the lights being on while he was using them so I would turn the lights off. But then I found out about a month ago that the button to turn the lights off doesn’t work and when you press it, it makes a very bad screeching sound for a few seconds, like it’s trying to connect to a bluetooth.

The quality is very high, given the price point.

The outward display is excellent. The battery life is extremely long and the quality of the headphones is very good for ear bud style headphones.\\n\\nThe range of the Bluetooth is phenomenal.

They fit very nicely around the ear and they come with a few different attachments so you can change the size of the earbud for maximum comfort. The quality of the sleeves are very high and the fit is very nice. It is very soft and smooth material.\\n\\nOverall, I would highly recommend these to anyone who is an avid listener of podcasts or music on any device and frequently uses headphones to not disturb those around them. These headphones do a great job at canceling outside noise and have a fantastic audio quality to them, especially given their price point. The sleek black design of these with very clear indicator lights makes them as aesthetically pleasing as they are comfortable. The case is very smooth and feels like frosted glass with a clear charging indicator on the front to check the remining capacity of the device. Also much to my surprise the headphones were at 94% charge when they arrived .\\n\\nOverall, this is just a great product and I would highly recommend it\", '', '', \"So far I really like these earbuds. They were extremely easy to connect via Bluetooth on my phone and no other set up besides that was needed. immediately after I took the plastic tabs off of each earbud it began charging from the precharged case that they came in. I really like how the case can be charged via USB and that it gives you a read out on how charged the earbuds are. Using the earbuds they do have quite a bit of bass and the volume can get decently high which I love. I also like that in total there are 3 different sizes on the ear piece part that goes into the ear. So that if the size that comes with it is too big or small you can try these out to get a better fit for your individual ear. I have tried out at least 3 other different types of wireless earbuds and these so far seem to be my favorite just because of the increased base and volume. They also seem to fit comfortably around my ear and don't wiggle too much. I plan to try them out while on a jog and I think they will actually do pretty well. The charging case really is pretty cool. the wireless earbuds snap into place magnetically so that if you have it open in your purse they don't just fall right out and mingle with everything else inside of your purse. The instruction manual is very simple and easy to read it even gives a great grid to refer back to for how to use the button on the wireless earbud. I do wish that it had a separate button for volume increase and volume decrease but so far the button seems to work OK for everything that it needs. Because the earbuds have a primary and secondary designation the batteries are different for each. The battery of the primary earbud dies faster than that of the secondary earbud which is normal. If you get a call on your phone while you're using the earbuds you have the option to answer it with one click or you can reject it with a long click. I really like the company that makes these. I have bought several different models from them and like them all. Very affordable. Considering getting my husband a pair. The manual says that they will stayed paired for up to 33 feet from your phone. They will stay charged for 8-10 hours. It only takes 2 hours to fully charge them on the case. It takes 3 hours for the case to recharge itself. Love how you can be mobile and charge these while out and about.\", \"I've purchased previous headphones from this same company and each time I’m very impressed with their quality. This time, I’m really loving these new headphones because I can use this to speak to friends on the phone while listen to music at the same time.\\n\\nOkay now, before you read on you need to understand. I wasn't looking for an awesome listening experience. I was looking for a inexpensive set that would produce sound at a level that still makes them useful while flying. I needed something that would last, sound great and have great quality.\\n\\nThe outside case:\\nSmall enough to fit into your pocket or handbag. There is an indicator on the outside that tells you how much battery life is remaining which is so cool and it will constantly charge your headphones when placed within the case. The lid is kept close with a small magnet, which is a nice thought. Unless your trying to close it without making any noise as the mentioned magnet loves to make it close with a very noticeable snap. Charging is very simple and the lights indicating the battery level makes knowing whats going on very easy.\\n\\nThe buds:\\nThey fit nicely, pairing was incredibly easy to complete and they do connect pretty much flawlessly every time they are taken out of the case. They sound great overall. You can control the volume and pause what your watching / listening to on the buds by placing your finger on the right spot.\\n\\nWith all of that said, if your looking for a set of buds that will give you the performance then it's worth checking out.

I started using these september year ago, and they worked great and still do in terms of audio. However, as of these past few months, the headphones have had some issues. The outer coating of the headphone padding has started to peel and shed off, leaving black specks on my face and neck. Additionally, the max charge has been steadily falling for a couple of months. Before, I could wake up early, fall asleep with them on, and wake up in the morning without them being on low battery. However, it has gradually dropped to about 18 hours, and today, they were only able to hold a charge for 13 hours. Again, these have seen pretty much daily use from me and have seen some rather unfavorable conditions (nothing too bad, just some light sprinkles and I don't believe water got inside), so this may just be a result of constant use. Maybe not a good choice for long term use, but other than that, I am very satisfied with these\", 'I have been using these for about 5 months, and I am really happy.

Sound is surprisingly good considering that I have some hearing loss. Blutooth connects quickly and volumn is easy to set. The earpads are also comfortable which is a big plus for me as I find most to become uncomfortable after just a short time.\", 'The se headphones are effective and give me a great sound for books or music. helpful on airplanes and around house while working. They connected easily to my Bluetooth systems.', 'When I excitingly opened my box I didn\\'t even bother to see or read anything just took the headphones out. Unsynched my Cowin E7 from my phone and added these. I noticed right away the E7 logo on the side and was like what the heck is this? I grabbed my old pair and was like. Umph whatever.\\n\\nI put them on and felt a bit off. But again thinking its because they are new silly goose. As you can see from my pictures, I USED AND ABUSED MY COWINS! I make music and they were a downgrade from my JVCs which I had for years. I bought my Cowins in 2019 I believe maybe sooner. I love them. I was shocked at the bass and the clarity of my music, other music and movies alike. They are perfect for the $50 I slapped down vs the $200 for my pair prior.\\n\\nWell needless to say the sound quality on these are trash in my opinion. I was listening to a song and was like this really isn\\'t right. So I like the genius I am not, put both pairs on and decided to switch back and force between the two during different parts of the song to compare and yeah they don\\'t live up.\\n\\nThe bass is weak which is a no go for me. The Cowins always had the bass on point so when I plugged into other sources like speakers and my car it was not too much nor too weak. These new E7 I can tell you right now if I don\\'t remember every time to mix correctly will have the bass way too deep every single time. Drawing out other components most likely.\\n\\nEven trying to watch a movie they are not as loud as my Cowins. I used the hold them side by side and crank it up test. I use to get stopped and stared at on the train, bus or walking, \"Those are seriously loud 😐\" \"Dang those are some good headphones\" \"How are those so loud?\" \"I can hear every word of what your listening to\" are just some of the comments/compliments I have gotten over the years. I do not think I will be getting the same reaction from these E7s.\\n\\nI\\'m super saddened by this as I\\'m seeing the old versions are no longer available. And it sucks. There\\'s nothing wrong with my cowins except they are very stretched out and as you can see the ear covers are just decimated. I think I\\'m going to gift my son with these new ones as he just uses them to game mostly.\\n\\nI\\'m really really sad you guys. Like pressed about this. Those Cowins were perfection.

By far one of the best headphones you could possibly get for the price. I bought another pair three years ago, the only reason I had to replace them was because I wore them so much the faux leather started peeling off.

I thought that these were just bluetooh headphones, but they also come with two headphone jacks; with and without a microphone! The audio quality is amazing, and they're super comfy and adjustable. They are noise canceling for the most part, if you don't have audio playing then they aren't completely noise canceling, but other than that, these are the best headphones ever!!\", \"Alright. Usually I'm a bit too lazy to right reviews but I just gotta say these are great.\\nI have some higher quality pricier over the ear headphones and I keep reverting back to using these. They're light, comfortable, the battery life is great and they look awesome.\\nPlus I'm noticing the range of the Bluetooth seems to be better than my higher price headphones. I can leave my phone in my bedroom and be out in the living room and these stay connected while my higher price headphones seem to cut out at that distance.\\nPlus, these seem to sit on my head better than my more expensive headsets too.\\nHonestly I got these because they were a cheaper option at the time, but I still use these just about daily and only end up using my higher prices headphones while this set is charging.\\nThis is by far the best headset I have.\", \"I bought these headphones to see how they stood up to the Skullcandy Crusher Evo Headphones.\\n\\nThough they are just as attractive and really comparable, the sound quality on them isn't as solid. They are a good option for 1/3 off the price. They are also more comfortable in that they are lighter on the head for long term wear and they come with a sturdier case - which were pluses.\\n\\nThey connect easily to bluetooth and are a great budget friendly option, though I chose to splurge on the SC.\\n\\nWell done! Recommended based on budget and usage.\", 'I bought a pair of these for my son and a pair for myself. They are really good headphones overall; comfy with good sound quality, but we both agree the battery life could be better.', \"I adore these headphones. Very comfortable, they cancel sounds so I can block out my older sister, battery charge is excellent, mic quality is great, I can call my grandma and she can hear me clearly. Plus the snake pattern, I love it! If I'm satisfied with how long I can use them before they retire, I'll come get another!\", \"They sound great to me. But I'm no expert on soud quality, so my satisfaction may be your disappointment. Bass is there but not as extreme as the description makes it sound.\\n\\nBattery life is average. My last pair could go four days of continuous use on one full charge whereas this one barely just barely makes it to 48 hours. Might do you better if you use your headphones less often than I do.\\n\\nWhen I used these headphones with my HP Laptop (especially on Youtube or similiar video hosting sites) I have to be careful not to pause the media too often or leave it pause to long, because when I press play again no sound will come through the heaphones even though its connected and the video is clearly playing. I used to be able to fix this by refreshing the page but that stopped working, so now I have to disconnect the bluetooth entirely and connect it again to fix it. I don't have this issue when connected to my phone.\\n\\nThe play/pause and foward/backward buttons on the headphones do not work on Youtube on my phone. Only volume commands work.

I listen to a lot of dubstep and other heavy bass music and these are not only comfy for long periods but sound great, 9 out of 10. 9 because they feel sort of flimsy and could break if I'm careless. I have Bluetooth earbuds that sound great too, but I don't like using them all the time like I do these.\", \"Very thicc earpads, but can feel pain for prolonged use probably since this is my first on ear. Weird build quality as there are 5 different plastic finishing but don't feel cheap. Decent sound.\", \"They sound as great as you might expect from Skull Candy earphones. I find on-ear headphones to be more comfortable than over ear headphones. So, I think these are comfortable. The midrange is scooped giving a pleasing bass and treble response. They're kind of flimsy though and the cord is only 4 ft long.\", 'For the price these are excellent headphones and a worthy candidate for \"daily driver.\" For me, these are computer/desk headphones. That is my use and that is probably how you should plan on using them as well. The cushions are very soft but the fit itself is on the firm side. Because the cushions are soft, they are nice and comfortable. Because the cushions are soft I\\'d be hesitant about getting too much sweat in them at the gym. They won\\'t fall off-- that\\'s not the issue-- but I\\'m guessing you don\\'t want to get the cushions wet. Are they durable? They sit at my desk. I thought about stuffing them in a \"getting too full\" backpack for a flight recently and I declined to do so. If you are really going to be putting them into very full bags maybe see if you can handle a pair in the store before making a decision. On the desk? As long as you aren\\'t yanking these things off you should be fine.\\n\\nSound review? This is hard because there is so much that goes into it. I\\'ll give it a shot. I can\\'t talk about leakage because I\\'m not usually around people when these are on. There is no noise cancelling but the fit and the pads do an okay job of getting rid of a lot of background noise. These replaced some Koss Porta-Pros and some old Sol headphones as my main laptop headphones. (That\\'s where I do most of my work.) So yes, I\\'m running off a laptop. No fancy power sources. They can get nice and loud and not bring in any distortion. That\\'s good. I guess these are probably \"somewhat warm\" sounding headphones. I listen to some vaporwave and a lot of metal (black/thrash and such) so I think I cover the need to hear all levels and ranges of sound and don\\'t have a need to focus on one aspect over the other but I guess the elephant in the room is always bass? It handles bass pretty well. It isn\\'t an overly aggressive bass sound but you can hear it nicely and distinctly. There is some punch to the bass but, to be sure, it isn\\'t at the level of beats headphones (and I like beats, but they are also a lot more money). Listening to some of the raw metal recordings, the bass is nice and it handles the distortion and rawness of metal tracks very well. So, the bass is good to the extent that the headphones generally maintain a consistent and clear sound-profile. And there is clearly more bass than more clear or neutral sounding headphones. It isn\\'t necessarily a bass heavy headphone but it is definitely bass capable. I can make the volume louder or softer without introducing any more distortion and I don\\'t have to listen to it loudly to \"hear\" the music.\\n\\nThese are very good headphones for the price. The four stars is because the headphone market is brutal and these are four star headphones, especially for the price. They are not magic value headphones that you would/could pay +$150 for, or something like that. That is, in my mind, going in to five star territory. For the price you will probably pay for these on this site, you are getting a really great pair of daily drivers and they are easy to recommend. I\\'m considering getting the (a) blue-tooth version of these.', 'Also nice that they can connect to your phone to play music.\\n\\nJokes aside, for the price point it is hard to beat the comfort, sound quality, and battery life here. I see a lot of people complaining about the “plastic-y” feeling but these are not $200+ headphones, and if you are expecting headphones that have better build then you are in the wrong price bracket. I will also mention these are the second set I owned. The previous model I had for 3+ years. These look and feel just about the same but with better battery. The durability is just fine', 'as per usual, skullcandy never disappoints. i\\'ve sworn by the jib series of earbuds for years and these headphones are just as high-quality as the in-ears. much like the jib headphones, they\\'re nice with the high-end but a little on the heavier side with low end. that\\'s not at all a minus for me. reminds me of the \"mega bass\" sony had for a while. the low end is not offensive at all but rather pleasant and fairly transparent.\\nthe cherry-on-top with these phones is the power they can handle. again, much like the jib earbuds, these phones can handle pretty much as much juice as your device is able to throw at it with no distortion. a phone won\\'t crank too much but i also tested them with a headphone amplifier and they blast!\\nthese headphones don\\'t have any noise-cancelling system but i generally avoid that anyway. they\\'re also not very quiet externally so if you\\'re blasting music, everyone around you will hear it, too. that may be a con for some but i only use these at home so no biggie.\\nthe only drawback for me is that they\\'re a little smaller than i expected (hand in the pic for scale reference), but that\\'s not at all a design flaw and not anything to bring it down from five stars.\\nthese headphones are great not just for the price but ESPECIALLY for the price. they perform every bit as well as anything you\\'d find in the $50-$100 range. if you\\'re looking for something for studio use, these are not for you as they\\'re made to sound good, not flat. but if you want to rattle your brain with clear, defined boomy sound, these are the ones!', \"I like the sound quality for audio recording and listening. Unfortunately, you get what you pay for - and the headband is flimsy and easily cracks and breaks. I won't be buying these again.\", \"Very practical.

I'm a bit of an audiophile and will often return headphones if they don't sound good (and trust me, a lot in this price range and even more expensive don't sound great).

When you start paying sounds on one, it overrides the other and vice versa. I have excessively large ears and head, and this headset fits my ears and doesn't press on my temples. The sound quality is great in my opinion, but I'm also not an audiophile. The noise cancellation isn't perfect, but it's great for the price point.

Sound quality is really good, much better than I was expecting for a cheap pair of Bluetooth headphones. Really like that the product also comes with an AUX cable. Battery life has been superb so far, used them in the gym for 4 days in a row doing my hikes (1 hour long, as well as walking to and from the gym, so about 1 1/2 hours) when I first got them, and the battery life had only dropped to 90%. Have only had to charge them twice so far, both times were the night before long journeys. Very impressed with the noise cancellation as well, I can't hear the other people in the gym when I've got my music turned up a fair amount. Highly recommend these headphones.\", \"Sinceramente non saprei cos'altro chiedere a delle cuffie.

Sound quality is really good, much better than I was expecting for a cheap pair of Bluetooth headphones. Really like that the product also comes with an AUX cable. Battery life has been superb so far, used them in the gym for 4 days in a row doing my hikes (1 hour long, as well as walking to and from the gym, so about 1 1/2 hours) when I first got them, and the battery life had only dropped to 90%. Have only had to charge them twice so far, both times were the night before long journeys. Very impressed with the noise cancellation as well, I can't hear the other people in the gym when I've got my music turned up a fair amount. Highly recommend these headphones.\", \"Sinceramente non saprei cos'altro chiedere a delle cuffie.

A little tight over my ears, but not bad. This is the 3rd pair of Power Locus headphones I have purchased. The other 2 were bought like 6 or 7 years ago, and still have great sound.

Charging stopped working about 3 months in (so no more Bluetooth features), then one of the headphone jacks got bent about 6 months in (still not entirely sure how, there was never any unreasonable force applied to it), and then the sound finally stopped working for good 7 months in. All in all, a lifespan of just over half a year.\\n\\nSummary: sound quality was really nice while it lasted, connecting with devices was easy, the sound cancelation was really just sound muffling, and it was incredibly easy to break.\\n\\nUPDATE: customer service reached out and sent me a free replacement, which was incredibly generous. So far, the new ones work great, although they act a bit differently than the old ones. I think these headphones just vary a lot.', 'With so many different options to chose from, I could not be happier with these wireless headphones! They come with a wire if needed and a great storage case but they were quite easy to set up as wireless headphones which I paired with my phone. The quality of the headphones themselves is great as well as the sound quality! The headphones expand to fit everyone in my family and the soft memory foam ear cups are really comfortable. I love the options in color and ordered the rose gold option. Great price for a great product!', \"They effectively cancel out the noise of the dryer and the fishtank filter, but can't compete with the noise of three kids making airplane noises.\", 'We love these.

Some were uncomfortable. Some had static, Some were dumb and if you went to do something like adjust volume it they would hang up on the person you were talking to… so I went into this purchase with the thought that they would last for a bit and then I’d be done. I love them!!! I can’t believe how affordable they were, they are comfortable, the sound is phenomenal. The quality and build of the product is long lasting plus the nice little storage case helps! Connecting to devices was simple and now they connect whenever I use them. Other devices I had to pair and impair to get to work,.. these know they are paired!!', 'These are amazing. Solid sound, great connectivity, super cute, and the price is hard to beat. In love with these headphones.', 'These headphones are pretty good for their price! They lasted me about a year and are pretty sturdy. They feel comfortable on your ears but the noise-cancelling is not that great. Additionally, the sound quality is decent but hollow at times. However, this is a really good steal and battery life lasts me about 4-5 days when using them about 2 hrs a day.', \"I purchased these about six months ago for my fifteen year old daughter. This is the first accessory she has had this long without damage. She takes then everywhere. She loves that they still work with a cord if the battery dies. I love that they fold because she had snapped several others I've purchased. They have a case as well, nice feature.\\nShe loves the sound and the charge time is remarkable.\\nVery pleased with these and the price tag.\", \"I purchased these for long haul flights - earbuds will give me a headache with extended use. These worked very well. It doesn't use the battery to plug them in (no need to even turn them on). I like that you can plug them in, as well as pair with a different device (like your phone). Worked perfectly for my flight.\", \"They work pretty good and sound quality seems pretty good. The only thing I dislike is there is an odd noise when no music is playing. It's pretty quiet but I notice it and it's annoying. I won't return them though because otherwise they work good and were very affordable.\", \"So I've been using these headphones for over a month now, and what I did notice about it is that with bluetooth audio is delayed, but with the jack cord it is not, now i don't mind it when it comes to music, because i'm not worried about the timing of it. Overall i really like them, comfortable fit, good sound quality, long lasting battery life, high bass. (which i like in my music) So give this one a try to see if it exceeds your expectations.

When you start paying sounds on one, it overrides the other and vice versa. I have excessively large ears and head, and this headset fits my ears and doesn't press on my temples. The sound quality is great in my opinion, but I'm also not an audiophile. The noise cancellation isn't perfect, but it's great for the price point.

Sturdy and well made!', 'Most headphone stands have some weighting in the bottom to keep them stable while you are placing or removing the headphones. This stand, however, does not.

I like to relax waiting for my appointments. This allows me to listen to my tunes at my leisure. It doesn’t hurt your ears. I can comfortably sleep on my side without compromising the sound quality. Let’s not forget how fashionable it looks. I got the butterfly pattern. It is definitely worth the price. I am mostly likely order another one so if it needs to be cleaned, I don’t have to wait to enjoy it.', \"I've been using this headband for about a week. My experience has been mostly positive.\\n\\nReading the reviews, I expected the earpieces to be a little uncomfortable when laying down. While I can certainly feel them, they are very round with no pokey edges, and the fabric is comfortable, so paired with a soft pillow, I have no trouble sleeping on my side. The ear pieces are in a long pocket. if you wear the headband as it comes, the ear pieces will likely be too far back for you. This is good, I think, since it allows for different people to adjust the location of the pieces to their liking. With a little finagling, you can get the speakers in place to your liking. If you really don't want them to shift as you wear them (which has not been a bother for me) you could get out your sewing kit and add a couple stitches behind the speaker, or around it as you like.\\nI will say that sleeping on my back is a little annoying, as the seam hits me at the nape of the neck. This will probably be more annoying for persons with shorter hair, but even people with longer hair like me may not find this too comfortable. I get by with a little adjusting.\\nI don't find the front control to be uncomfortable in any way, but you can feel it being there, so be mindful of that.\\nThe material is very soft, and is thin. I find it very comfortable. It does ride up a bit on my head with wear, even when I'm not sleeping. I find myself adjusting it back down to my ears every so often. This doesn't bother me, but it's worth noting. because it rides up, it makes my hair look really dumb. I am not likely to wear this in front of anyone I want to impress for this reason, and because of the front control panel. It is very comfortable as an eye mask when I sleep.\\nIt falls off as I sleep in it overnight. This is not an issue for me as I only use it to go to sleep, not to stay asleep. It is easy for me to find in the morning, unlike the bluetooth corded ear buds I used to use, which I have lost.\\nI use this headband to listen to 20 minute stories as I go to sleep, which helps me ignore my snoring roommate. I used to have trouble falling asleep to snoring, but while I can still technically hear the snoring, I have had no such trouble since trying this product.\\nIt charges pretty fast. I was very surprised on the first charge when it seemed to fill up in a matter of minutes. I wonder if it was pre-charged when it arrived. I have not drained the battery much, since then and I charge it every day. I don't use the audio feature all night long. I only use these headphones for 20 minute stories to go to sleep to, and sometimes to listen to Youtube videos while my roommate sleeps, which is sometimes an hour or two. The battery life has never gone as low as halfway, and usually not very low at all.\\nThe speakers seem to work perfectly for my needs. I'm not audiophile, but I seem to hear my videos as clearly as any other headphones or through my phone's native speaker, which is all I ask.\\nThis was the perfect solution for me.\", 'I bought these to use while walking or at the gym. I have now added wearing them to the laundromat while washing clothes. I have also slept with them. I even wore them to Walmart to do grocery shopping.\\n\\nComfort - They are very comfortable.\\nNoise Cancellation - They are not noise cancelling but I want to be able to hear what is going on around me so that was a good thing. Five stars on this feature simply because it did not cancel the noise and that is what I was looking for. Five stars because I did not want noise cancelling and I got what I wanted.\\nSound quality - For what I use them for the sound was fine. I listen to audiobooks/podcasts and stream movies so my only requirement is that the voices are clear. Five stars on this feature because again it worked for me.\\nVolume Control - The control buttons are good. There are 3 buttons and they protrude a bit. If I need to power them on and off I just feel for the center button and long press it. The up and down buttons are on either side of the power button. It is easy for me to find them by feel.\\nBattery - While I was using them only 2 or 3 hours a day the battery lasted multiple days before charging them. I now charge them daily due to using them to sleep (see my notes for sleep below).\\nSleeping - The only thing I want to note is, if you intend to use them for sleep, make sure to keep them charged daily. The reason for this is there is a loud voice the proclaims \"LOW BATTERY\" and it is LOUD. Even when the speaker volume is low the voice is LOUD. Charging them every morning will prevent this from being a problem. A full charge lasts all night.\\nMovement - While walking around or biking I do not find that they move around much. The headband stays in place. Sometimes the speakers will shift a bit but it is just a matter of reaching up and sliding the speaker back into place. There is no need to adjust the entire band. Now sleeping is a different matter. They usually do not stay in place at night. I usually wake up in the morning with them either completely off or just around my forehead (think 80s aerobics videos). This is fine for me. I mostly use them to help me fall asleep. Also, I am a restless sleeper. I toss and turn A LOT. They may stay in place better for someone who moves around less.\\nCleaning - Cleaning is easy. I do sweat a good bit when walking so they get sweaty. I remove the electronics and put them in the washer (cold water) and let them air dry. It can be a bit time consuming to put the electronics back in but it is not too bad.\\nDurability - I have owned this pair for over a year. I bought them June 2022 and this review is being written August 2023. In this time I have noticed no change in their function. I am, in fact, planning to buy a second pair for rotation while one pair is in laundry.\\n\\nOverall rating of four stars. Deducted one star for the awkward \"LOW BATTERY\" notification. They are listed as \"sleep\" in the description but that voice could wake up light sleepers.', 'This is a weird review, but hopefully it can help someone as it has me. This is a great product and works for all the expected uses. But, when I had a recent asthma exacerbation and I just could NOT sleep when hearing myself wheeze, this device helped. Earplugs help when someone ELSE was making sleeping noises, snoring, etc, but only amplified my own breathing noises. Everytime I hear myself wheeze, I feel the need to reposition or cough so…no sleep for me. I tried regular earbuds but they aren’t comfortable or practical for a full night sleep. THEN, I tried this earbud headband. Very comfortable.

Sometimes the speakers will shift a bit but it is just a matter of reaching up and sliding the speaker back into place. There is no need to adjust the entire band. Now sleeping is a different matter. They usually do not stay in place at night. I usually wake up in the morning with them either completely off or just around my forehead (think 80s aerobics video\n",
